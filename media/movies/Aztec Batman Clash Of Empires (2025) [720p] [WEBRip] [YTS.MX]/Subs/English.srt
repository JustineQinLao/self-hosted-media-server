CLASH OF EMPIRES

6
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,098
BASED ON DC CHARACTERS

7
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,864
Father?

8
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,076
Papa? Tahtli!

9
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,779
No!

10
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,950
Another vision?

11
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,037
A nightmare, I'd say.
Must have been that old huitlacoche I ate.

12
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,583
Ah, I've never known you
to eat old huitlacoche, my son.

13
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,878
Especially so many times in a row.

14
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,504
It's nothing, Papa. Just the corn.

15
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,592
Don't you ever ignore your dreams, Yohu,
no matter where they come from.

16
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,512
Now, then, if it was nothing,
then let us be thankful for that.

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,182
Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan.

18
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,856
Tlaca--

19
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,528
You will give our Bat God
the respect that he is due.

20
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,739
Even your mother
would not have blamed him.

21
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,783
Her death was not his fault.

22
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,580
But he also didn't lift a finger
to save her.

23
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,916
Even when we prayed
with the utmost respect.

24
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,919
She's watching over you. You know that.

25
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,129
Yes, Pa. I know.

26
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,215
Your mother's got her eye on you
right next to Tzinacan.

27
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,760
Now don't forget, son,
your training isn't a game,

28
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,971
so before you join the village--

29
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:47,477
Ah, it's always so unnerving
when our Young Shadow vanishes like that.

30
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,522
GULF OF MEXICO COAST

31
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,719
Hey! Yohu!

32
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,486
Let's begin with the overhead strike.

33
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,531
Shields!

34
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,369
They are your best defense.
Now show me your side-kick.

35
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,708
Yohu! And hold. Don't move a muscle.

36
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,877
The position of your arm
needs to be higher.

37
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,880
Or your strike will completely lack power.

38
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,135
All right. Let's continue.

39
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,682
I know how difficult it was for you
after the death of your mother,

40
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,475
but now that you're grown up,

41
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,894
it's time you get serious
about your future.

42
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,355
Don't scold me, please.

43
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,025
When you take my place,

44
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,861
it'll be your duty
to always be ready for battle

45
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,531
and, when your people need you,
to serve them as best you can.

46
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:28,120
Remember, fear can kill you
or inspire you to action.

47
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,954
It's your call.

48
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,497
You're-- You--

49
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,583
What are those?

50
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,252
Look! Mountains carried by clouds!

51
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,547
No. Those are monsters
from the depths.

52
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,655
They look like they're gods.

53
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,866
Listen carefully to what they say, Yohu,

54
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,202
but pay closer attention to how they act.

55
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,955
That's how you can tell
if they're gods or not.

56
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,551
Mm.

57
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,637
Mm.

58
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,846
I salute you, blessed people.

59
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,057
I am Captain Hernán Cortés.

60
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,434
I've come to your lands
in the name of Almighty God

61
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,977
and the Holy Roman Emperor,

62
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,898
His Majesty Charles I,
the king of Castilla.

63
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,819
I am Chief Toltecatzin,
first son of Oquitzin.

64
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,029
May I ask the reason you come?

65
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,990
I am exploring the New World.

66
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,493
You found a new world?

67
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,079
The vast green landscape
stretching out before us,

68
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,998
it's called the New World
since we only just discovered it.

69
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,169
Many suns have already passed
since our people first knew these lands.

70
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,590
We seem to find ourselves low on supplies.

71
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,096
Would you be willing to make a trade?

72
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,305
No.

73
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,599
No?

74
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,563
Our village has plenty that we can share.

75
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,898
Join us. You shall be our honored guests.

76
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,154
That is excellent.
What a splendid idea.

77
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,127
My lord, I don't trust
these pale strangers one iota.

78
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,672
They act as if this village
now belongs to them.

79
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,257
I understand your frustration,
old warrior.

80
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,093
Tonight I'll consult
the judgment of the gods.

81
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,554
We shall let them decide.

82
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,931
Want another? We have plenty.

83
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,268
Diego sent us here to get gold,
not to fill our bellies.

84
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,979
And he'll get it, once we discover--

85
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,857
Your fabled city swimming in gold?

86
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:07,028
Gold is what makes Diego
and the authorities happy.

87
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,907
My plans with God
are far more grand than such riches.

88
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,415
I would like to thank you all
for this warm welcome.

89
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,252
Allow me to show you
some of the wonders of my world.

90
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,463
Inventions, ideas,

91
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,506
from some of our brightest minds.

92
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,469
Behold!

93
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,558
And this is Toledo,

94
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,188
the most glorious city in Castilla,
the land where I come from.

95
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,981
I've heard your capital is beautiful.

96
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,359
- Tenochtitlán?
- "Tenochtitlán."

97
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Oh, thank you.

98
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,697
I want to say it right when I get there.

99
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,493
And finally, this is an arquebus,

100
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,538
or, as some Mexicas already know it...

101
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,379
...the thunder of the gods!

102
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:10,091
- Time for bed, Young Shadow.
- But it's still light out, Tahtli.

103
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,886
Your father is right.
Enough talk for today.

104
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,638
Until tomorrow, Chief Toltecatzin.

105
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,807
Rest well, Young Yohualli.

106
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,107
And their armor looks so shiny,
almost like the skin of a fish,

107
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,236
and yet it seems also like it's as hard
as a turtle shell.

108
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,197
And their writings possess magic.

109
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,783
One even showed how to fly like a bird.

110
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,703
Is it possible? To fly?

111
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,545
Again you're asking for advice
from Tzinacan?

112
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,715
I pray for guidance and for answers.

113
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,718
I believe that they do look like gods.

114
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,510
They're not gods.

115
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,097
But if it's Tezcatlipoca who advises them,

116
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,975
then they might be as devious
as they are powerful.

117
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,936
In that case,
then wouldn't that make them gods?

118
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,563
Do you remember Acatzin?

119
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,149
The one who watches
over our house in the city?

120
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,484
I think so, yeah.

121
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,362
- Do you think that Cortés--?
- Enough with Cortés.

122
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,491
Please, if something bad happens to me,
go find Acatzin, and he will help.

123
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,994
Yes, Pa.

124
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,096
Pa?

125
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,898
What was that? Thunder?

126
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,567
- I'm scared, Mama.
- Huh?

127
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,828
- What is it, Father?
- For now, nothing. Keep quiet, though.

128
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,631
Chief Toltecatzin, we are grateful
for your generous hospitality.

129
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,715
It was nothing.

130
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,594
What might be nothing to some people
can be everything to others.

131
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,847
That's why my men and I
require a little bit more from you.

132
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,392
The location of Tenochtitlán.

133
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,770
Impossible. We have strict rules
in place that forbid this.

134
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,107
Rules are rules. Hmm.

135
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,608
Ah. How about this idea?

136
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,194
What if you joined our expedition
and showed us?

137
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,448
Even better, Yohu could be my herald
and announce my arrival to the Sun King.

138
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,409
- Yes.
- That's out of the question.

139
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,120
Father, please. I can do it.

140
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,206
The boy is more than old enough
to make his own decisions,

141
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,541
don't you think?

142
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,336
Captain Cortés speaks the truth.
I'm a grown man.

143
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,463
That's what you said.

144
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,716
Listen close, son.

145
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,137
If anything happens,
you run and go straight to Acatzin.

146
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,723
Take your mother as well.
She'll protect you.

147
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,403
Do you see his hair?
How it shines like the sun?

148
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,197
Is he a god, Mama?

149
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,908
Tonatiuh.

150
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,372
- Tonatiuh.
- Tonatiuh is here.

151
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,336
I will personally request for an audience
on your behalf with Moctezuma.

152
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,006
Meanwhile, you shall wait in our village
as our guests of honor.

153
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:41,636
Ah, it's best to arrive unannounced.
Besides, everybody loves surprises.

154
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,264
Well, that all depends on the surprise.

155
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,894
So you still don't trust me, hmm?

156
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,189
You have nothing to fear.
We're Christians. We are here to help you.

157
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,523
The gods!

158
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,652
- The gods have arrived!
- Back, or I'll kill you.

159
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,411
This is help in your world? No!

160
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,042
None of you strangers are gods!
You're nothing but liars and murderers!

161
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:19,549
As long as I draw breath,
you'll never see Tenochtitlán.

162
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,969
Fine.

163
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,264
Thank you for such wise counsel.

164
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,113
Slaughter them all!

165
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,885
Tahtli!

166
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,221
Papa!

167
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,100
Pa. I'm sorry.

168
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,019
That decides it.

169
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,855
You're coming with me now.

170
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,946
Filthy wretch!

171
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,162
It courses through your veins.

172
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,999
It runs through your body.

173
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,420
Mama?

174
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,050
Through all of our bodies.

175
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,719
You must fight...

176
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,263
or die.

177
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,848
Fight...

178
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,476
and die.

179
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,602
Your life...

180
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,771
it must be in balance.

181
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,483
Our world...

182
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,986
must also be in balance.

183
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,826
Huh?

184
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,767
No, he isn't ready yet.

185
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,435
Give him a test, you say?

186
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,938
Hmm. Perhaps.

187
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,606
Excuse me.

188
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,566
Is this Mictlán?

189
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,485
No. You aren't dead.

190
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,195
Not yet.

191
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,447
Then what is...? Please, I have to leave.

192
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,949
Which way is the path...

193
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,786
...to...?

194
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,830
What is that?

195
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,833
What you witnessed will come true.

196
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,752
But not all of what you saw
has come to pass yet.

197
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,129
There's time.

198
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,340
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

199
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,094
- What is this place?
- It's the beginning for you...

200
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,929
and the end.

201
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,225
- It wouldn't be wise to say any more.
- You crazy witch.

202
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,424
Huh?

203
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,940
It's you.

204
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,650
You, who let my mother die.

205
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,986
Did you see what they did to my father?

206
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,362
To my village?

207
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,950
How is this a balance of justice?
You have done nothing!

208
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,953
That's because you're a lie!

209
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,675
Help me! Get them off! Get them off!

210
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,468
What is this?

211
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,102
Huh?

212
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:03,643
I can give you a little food,
but I told you, you cannot sleep here.

213
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,603
Yohualli?

214
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,148
Are you all right? Where's your father?

215
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,194
Acatzin!

216
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,867
Oh, my dear Yohu.

217
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:26,582
MOCTEZUMA'S PALACE

218
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
You're not alone, Yohu.

219
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,837
I've been at your side
since the day you were born.

220
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,926
You're saying you were robbed
by a Jaguar God?

221
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,468
That's absurd.

222
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,555
Try telling that to my guards
with the scars on their faces.

223
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,141
It slashed them all with its flying claws.

224
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,476
This isn't the first time
it's stolen from us either.

225
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,361
This humble servant comes
before Your Eminence

226
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,072
to present his new lord, Yohualli Coatl,

227
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,534
son of Chief Toltecatzin
from the Smoking Village.

228
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,330
Is this the young man
who saw the teúles and their leader?

229
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,499
Yes, I am the one, high priest,
that saw them.

230
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,670
You may speak,
Little Lord of the Forest.

231
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:18,550
Huey Tlatoani Moctezuma II is listening.

232
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:23,264
Their leader, he calls himself
Captain Hernán Cortés.

233
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,309
He came into our village with soldiers.

234
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,104
- My father, he shared food with them--
- What else happened?

235
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,150
Cortés wanted to know
how to find Tenochtitlán.

236
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,902
Hmm? Hmm.

237
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,279
My father refused.

238
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,157
Cortés murdered him,

239
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,909
then slew my whole village.

240
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,788
But not you? You must run fast, then.

241
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,209
Cortés seems to behave
the same way gods act towards men.

242
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,463
Sometimes he will be kind.
Other times, cruel.

243
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,840
What's your take on this,
High Priest Yoka?

244
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,343
Are they men or are they gods?

245
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,514
Gods, Your Eminence.

246
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,350
And we should invite them here
to prevent them from getting angry.

247
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,853
- No!
- Silence, you little--

248
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,271
Go ahead, young one.

249
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,402
Cortés is not a god.
But he is a powerful and cruel man.

250
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,237
He must be stopped
before he sets foot in this city.

251
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:24,199
This boy from the provinces
is but a simple warrior.

252
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,202
What gift was he endowed

253
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,331
to know who is or isn't a god?

254
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,544
Please, my lord,
I beg you to heed my words.

255
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,629
We shall test their capabilities.

256
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,591
Although, if they were gods,
they'd get here on their own.

257
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,648
He has no idea how dangerous Cortés is.

258
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,236
I believe you,
but Yoka is the city's high priest.

259
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,446
He speaks directly to the gods.

260
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,697
He knows them.

261
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,493
The gods don't need to use weapons
when they come to take your head.

262
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,955
- What are you talking about, Yohualli?
- Cortés murdered my father.

263
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,957
He spoke of my right to seek revenge.

264
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,127
At your age, no one expects you
to take such rash action.

265
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,464
Avenging my tahtli isn't rash action.

266
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,674
- It's my debt.
- No, it's not.

267
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:27,096
You don't understand.
I wouldn't listen. I wasn't ready to.

268
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,891
I let fear take control.

269
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,935
I vow never to make that mistake again.

270
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,646
I want you to train me
to become the greatest warrior

271
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,356
that the world has ever known.

272
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,194
I'm to going to stop Cortés
and his soldiers.

273
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,988
Your wish is my command, my lord.

274
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,283
Damn that Yohu!

275
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,536
The prophecies are certain!

276
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,998
Insolent forest whelp!

277
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:01,631
Tlacatlé, totecoé Huitzilopochtli!

278
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,719
Tlacatlé, totecoé Huitzilopochtli!

279
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,475
Is that doubt I sense?

280
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:17,939
No, I would never. I'd never doubt you.

281
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,315
But what of the king?

282
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:24,529
Are you saying you doubt yourself, Yoka?

283
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,198
Make him see.

284
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,710
And again.

285
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:51,973
And again.

286
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,771
And again.

287
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,948
And again.

288
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,677
Hmm.

289
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,143
ALLIANCE WITH TLAXCALTECAS

290
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:47,028
CHOLULA MASSACRE

291
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,857
- The teúles are at our door.
- Just as I predicted.

292
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,484
Nothing will hinder them,

293
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,862
for they are gods,
and they deserve our welcome.

294
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,406
And you, Yohualli Coatl?

295
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,451
What do you think?
Will it be impossible to stop them?

296
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,161
Give me the order, great king.

297
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,331
My warriors and I are more than ready
to test them in combat.

298
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,376
Death to the pale invaders!

299
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,920
We'll push them back into the sea!

300
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,464
He's insane, Your Majesty.

301
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,092
It's a fool's errand
to wage war against the gods.

302
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,262
Huey tlatoani,
these intruders are not gods.

303
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,639
I swear upon the blood of my parents.

304
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,266
I have much to think over.

305
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:03,688
In any case, I expect you to be prepared,
regardless of my decision.

306
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,903
CORTÉS ARRIVES IN TENOCHTITLÁN

307
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,739
Look. A silver metropolis.

308
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,574
It's even bigger than Toledo.

309
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,952
What did I say, Pedro?

310
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,789
That we'd soon find
their hidden metropolis.

311
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,374
And finally, we are here!

312
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,837
There must be a mountain of gold
and riches within.

313
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,507
But we won't know until we're inside.

314
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,428
Let us make for the city gates.

315
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,817
I salute you, O blessed people.

316
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,319
I am Captain Hernán Cortés.

317
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:57,449
I'm here in the name of God
and King Charles I of Castilla.

318
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,993
I humbly ask permission to enter

319
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,955
so I may share the many wonders
of my world with you.

320
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:17,052
Persuade the king
that he must open the gates to the teúles.

321
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,222
Yohualli Coatl clouded his judgment
with foolhardy counsel.

322
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,185
Tloque Nahuaque ,
Yohualli Ehecatl, Ipalnemohuani!

323
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,853
He refuses to listen.

324
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,939
If it's what I desire, he will listen.

325
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,237
You are my voice on earth, son. Go.

326
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,075
Huey tlatoani, I beg you,

327
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,411
please welcome the teúles into the city.

328
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,469
The time is nigh. Rise, gentlemen!

329
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,180
Time to claim what's ours!

330
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,061
- Show no mercy.
- Kill every last one.

331
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,398
Tell us, war leader,
what are your orders?

332
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,691
Allow them inside.

333
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,834
We're entering into the lion's den.

334
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,627
Everything will be all right.

335
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,505
How do you know this?
Did the Lord tell you?

336
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,882
Yes.

337
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,759
Every morning, I hear from him on high.

338
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,431
"Hernán, it is all in your hands."

339
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,278
Hmm.

340
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,998
Yoka, why are they not satisfied
by our many sacrifices and offerings?

341
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,416
They look like teúles.

342
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,462
Perhaps they wish us
to present them with different gifts.

343
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,267
Is it you?

344
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,896
- Are you...? Are you Moctezuma?
- Yes.

345
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,981
I am Moctezuma.

346
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,691
Welcome to our city, my lord.

347
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,318
Take your rightful throne.

348
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,946
I've watched over it
for you all this time.

349
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:27,825
My predecessors Itzcoatl,
Moctezuma I and Axayácatl

350
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,746
all proclaimed that one day
you'd come for what's yours.

351
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,998
And today is the day.

352
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,878
Welcome, at long last,
to your destined land.

353
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,175
I'm Hernán Cortés,
first emissary of God

354
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,137
and the Holy Roman Emperor,
King Charles I.

355
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,556
- You think they're Gods?
- The king will know.

356
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,933
I've come all this way
to show you the many wonders...

357
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:52,976
He touched the king!

358
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,189
- It's forbidden to touch him!
- The gods would never do such a thing!

359
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,109
Uh, would you like, O great king,

360
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,486
for us to speak in a place
that's a bit more...?

361
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,029
- See that, child?
- Citlālim popōca!

362
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,656
The teúles used their godlike powers

363
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,492
to cause citlālim popōca
to appear in the sky!

364
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,327
- In the sky!
- It's a sign.

365
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,997
- What is it, Hernán?
- Be on your guard.

366
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,125
No! Not the end!
How could you have missed this?

367
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,336
Was it because--
Because I delayed in welcoming Cortés?

368
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,756
Or because I allowed him in?
Why does the end approach us? Yoka!

369
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,636
Great and powerful king, I...
I don't know.

370
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,899
Tzinacan, protect this city.

371
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,113
Help our people survive
this great calamity--

372
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,823
Are you going somewhere? At this hour?

373
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,783
Cortés won't sit on his hands
and do nothing.

374
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,201
He'll explore the streets.

375
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,162
But you won't be able
to fight him at night.

376
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,624
Not without the protection of the Sun God.

377
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,294
Fortunately, my family
worships a night god.

378
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,421
Tzinacan owes me.

379
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,173
Blasphemy.

380
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:09,802
Cortés is a royal guest.
He's been offered hospitality by the king.

381
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,971
To touch him now
would merit a sentence of death.

382
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,225
This is why you trained me.
To avenge my father.

383
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,729
So if you won't help, then leave.

384
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,980
I release you from my service.

385
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,569
My lord, in the spirit
of my continuing to assist you,

386
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,616
what say you to the idea
of wearing a costume?

387
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,302
It's not gold, but it shines.

388
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,306
Please excuse my friend.
His manners are rather brash.

389
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,350
Please, consider it my gift to you.

390
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,895
I guess those rumors about the teúles
and gold turned out to be true.

391
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,855
But did you know
it's the sun's excrement?

392
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,525
How dare you?!

393
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,528
Huh?

394
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,927
I'll gut you slowly,
like you're some pathetic little cur.

395
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,347
Wait! I want to see what he's capable of.

396
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,934
Your arrogance will be your death.

397
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,396
You took the words right out of my mouth.

398
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,819
You murdered my father!

399
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:56,701
I can't seem to recall
exactly who he was,

400
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,329
but when you see him again,
give him my regards.

401
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,468
Hand me the arbalest!

402
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,612
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. Over here.

403
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,571
Let's go.

404
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,699
This isn't over.

405
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,248
Are you coming or not?

406
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,424
Wow! Did you feel that?

407
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,803
Yes. That was a really good fight.

408
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,055
"Yes. That was a really good fight."

409
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,265
Come on, get excited.

410
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,101
You could at least be a little thankful
you're still breathing.

411
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,395
Tlazocamati.

412
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,609
Thank you. I'm very grateful.
You were brave.

413
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,111
- You're pretending to be a Jaguar Goddess?
- Same as you.

414
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,532
Except I invoke the powerful,
untamed spirit of the jaguar.

415
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,076
Ah. I saw.

416
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,452
I'm intrigued.

417
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,663
What were you thinking
when you ran at them

418
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,248
like a chicken without its head?

419
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,834
That Cortés was weaker.

420
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,793
I was mistaken.

421
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:32,463
But I will find a way to defeat him,
no matter what it costs me.

422
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,882
Sounds suicidal.

423
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,801
I guess it's good
we have opposing missions, then.

424
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,885
Perhaps.

425
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,389
But at least mine's a mission of honor,
unlike certain people that--

426
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,183
- Steal? That's what you were gonna say?
- I didn't mean--

427
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,729
Next time, I'll just let them chop you up
for their soup like a tuna.

428
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,608
Hmm.

429
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,900
AXAYÁCATL'S PALACE

430
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,988
- I can close your wound, my captain.
- Find that bat and that cat.

431
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,031
But your infection will only worsen.

432
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,034
Drown them in the lake.

433
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,912
Then draw and quarter them.

434
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,998
Did you hear me, Pedro?

435
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,960
Mm-hm. Don't be upset,
but the men and I were talking,

436
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,463
and we think that back in Toledo
you'll find the best doctors in the world,

437
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,632
who can heal your...

438
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,259
Uh, your scratch.

439
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,595
I see.

440
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,265
You all wish to return home,
then, don't you?

441
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:30,314
Perhaps, then, you need reminding
that there's still a mission to complete.

442
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,323
That's why I commanded
all our ships be set ablaze.

443
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,744
Now that you've all been made aware,

444
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,955
who wants stay here with me?

445
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:51,543
Anyone else can swim
all the way back to Cuba.

446
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:56,089
And then she used this whip
to balance herself and--

447
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,091
It's just... she's so resourceful.

448
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,595
- Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan!
- Huh?

449
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,014
- I'll make an offering.
- But she's not an actual goddess.

450
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,808
It's not for her.
It's for Tzinacan.

451
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,769
Oh. All right.

452
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,105
- For sending her to save you.
- No. No one sent her to save me.

453
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,732
She stopped you from getting killed.

454
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,943
Of course she was sent
by him to save you.

455
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:21,405
Listen, the more important point here
is that, even with all of your training,

456
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,532
I can't defeat the teúles
and their weapons.

457
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,201
What's your next move, then?

458
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,536
I need to learn how their inventions work

459
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,789
and use that knowledge
to gain the upper hand.

460
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,582
But how will you even get close?

461
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,210
They're not going to invite you in
to study them.

462
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,255
- I'll be careful?
- Hmm. Too risky.

463
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,299
If only there was somebody
that you know

464
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,096
who was stealthy
and who had sticky fingers.

465
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,515
Perhaps they'd be able to help you.

466
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,642
Ahh.

467
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,564
Huh?

468
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,911
Didn't take long for you to miss me.

469
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,544
Stop! I'm not your enemy.

470
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,504
My mission's to take back what we've lost.

471
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,840
But you wouldn't understand,
since you're one of them.

472
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,177
I just want to talk.

473
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,596
- Then talk.
- Sorry for following you.

474
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,724
But I needed to know what you did
with the things you steal.

475
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,268
- And now that you know?
- You saved me.

476
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,895
I want to do the same thing for you.

477
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,647
But please, you have to stop stealing
from our people.

478
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,026
At least don't do it while Cortés
is trying to take everything from us.

479
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,195
And if I don't? You'll kill me?

480
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,489
No. But in these times,
someone else could.

481
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,575
Don't throw your life away
when you have so much to live for.

482
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,620
What do you care for the life
of another dishonorable thief?

483
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,873
A path of dishonor that aims
towards good deserves admiration.

484
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,543
Now, please. I could really use your help.

485
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,300
Must have been hard
realizing you needed me, wasn't it?

486
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,802
Looks like you were right.

487
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,513
By night, the guards patrol this place
in a pattern.

488
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,307
And if you want to get in
without having to fight them,

489
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,975
repeat the magic words.

490
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,186
I'm sorry for being rude to you.

491
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,271
I shall forever be in your debt,
great jaguar,

492
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,107
for teaching me the ways of the night.

493
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,526
Uh-huh. Very well.

494
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,738
Next time, try your best not to sound
like a chicken with its head cut off.

495
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,481
Pretty clever idea
to disarm the enemy from afar,

496
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,984
- don't you think?
- Mm.

497
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,831
Well, that's odd.

498
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,917
There's still a while
before the Atlcahualo festival.

499
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,422
These trees weren't for the festival.
Cortés is behind this.

500
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,217
- What's he doing with them?
- Nothing good.

501
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
Ah. Is this the place?

502
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,231
Yes. It was here.

503
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,445
This is the forgotten temple of Tzinacan.

504
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,156
I thought it was a myth, though.

505
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,881
So you said
that when you were wounded,

506
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:52,885
you ran all the way from your village
to a temple you had no idea existed,

507
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,804
one that your father had discovered
in his earlier years?

508
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,805
I got lucky.

509
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,350
Luck's has absolutely nothing
to do with this.

510
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,561
The Bat God guided you
that day to its lair.

511
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,521
Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan!

512
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,858
No! Stop it, Acatzin!

513
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,486
That day, Tzinacan left us all to die.

514
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,864
But, my lord, what about
the forest goddess that helped you?

515
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,824
She was nothing but a hallucination.

516
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,826
It was the fever, exhaustion, who knows?

517
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,288
You're so stubborn.
Blindness are those who refuse to see.

518
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,000
Stubborn and maddening are those
who see a stone god altar

519
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,127
and think it's listening to them.

520
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:32,174
You're the Bat God's chosen one, my lord.
You've been given a sacred mission.

521
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,802
And whether you accept it or not,
it's the truth.

522
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,638
If you really believe in the gods,
then let's test you.

523
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,767
Stand there and don't move a single finger
until night falls.

524
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,686
Yes, my lord. It'll be a great honor.

525
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,396
I'll be as still as a chinicuil worm

526
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,357
as it hides in the dirt
from a hungry bird.

527
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,820
Ah. Huh?

528
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,698
No! Get them off me! Get them off me!

529
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,367
See, guess it's not such a sacred mission
after all, is it?

530
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,208
You do exist. Forgive me for doubting.

531
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,253
You're not the first nor the last
to have doubted.

532
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,755
Ask your questions.

533
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:56,175
Tell me how to defeat Cortés.
How to get the teúles out of the city.

534
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,012
Without him, you don't exist.

535
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,222
Without him, you cannot win.

536
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,516
Is it better to earn his trust
or kill him?

537
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,894
What's Cortés doing with all those trees?

538
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,437
When empires clash,

539
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,564
some will rise,

540
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,232
others fall.

541
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,902
A great metamorphosis will take place,

542
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:18,822
and the gods shall anoint
their chosen emissaries,

543
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,867
whether they know it or not.

544
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,660
Balance depends on them.

545
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Not by way of vengeance

546
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,581
but through sacrifice.

547
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,209
For all must move in eternal momentum.

548
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,880
I don't understand you!
Stop speaking in riddles for once!

549
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,967
Respect the will of the gods!

550
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:42,930
Was it a vision?

551
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,850
Just go back to sleep.

552
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:51,563
Oftentimes the gods use dreams
as a way to speak to the chosen ones.

553
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,109
That's how they offer guidance
during times of great adversity.

554
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,445
Then someone should tell them
to be a little less confusing.

555
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,572
Well, some gods speak to you plainly,

556
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,910
while there are others
who will act quiet or more evasive.

557
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,828
Some visit to tell you the truth,

558
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:10,375
while others seek to deceive
and torment you, such as Tezcatlipoca.

559
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,210
You must be extremely careful
with that god.

560
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,547
Try and get some sleep.

561
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,591
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

562
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,433
Our people believe
that they have powers,

563
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,810
but they don't think they are gods.

564
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,728
The white rock discovered
upon their arrival is proof

565
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,315
that they are correct,
contrary to all that Yoka has said.

566
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,901
Tell him he must feed them.

567
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,195
That he is wrong about the teúles.

568
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,613
They are hungry.

569
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,823
Oh, good, my lord.

570
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,491
Huitzilopochtli, he assures me

571
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,078
our visitors are not some sort
of cosmic test we must overcome.

572
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,414
On the contrary,
we must satisfy their hunger.

573
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,917
Your answer is always
more and more sacrifices.

574
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,127
You disappoint me, Yoka.

575
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,713
Now I am certain
that for us to achieve peace,

576
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:01,341
every member of this kingdom
will have to right their wrongs,

577
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,509
including you!

578
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,890
No! Not this! No!

579
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:11,143
- I beg you, my lord, no!
- You are hereby banished, Yoka.

580
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:14,062
Go to the mountain
and contemplate the ruin

581
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,315
that your choices have brought upon us.

582
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,692
But I am your most faithful!

583
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:23,573
I am the gods' messenger!
Please, I don't deserve this!

584
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:38,963
Huh?

585
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,926
To arms! It's the Bat Warrior!

586
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:07,282
Dealing with this infernal bat is starting
to become quite the endless headache.

587
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,328
For now, there's a more urgent matter
we must attend to.

588
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,123
Ah, yes.

589
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,837
It seems the glorious governor
of the island of Cuba

590
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,882
is ordering me to return,

591
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,177
like some useless mongrel!

592
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,179
What's his messenger been up to?

593
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,515
Watching everything
so he may report you.

594
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,809
Send him inside.

595
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,435
Did you reconsider?

596
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,688
Will you obey Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar,

597
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,233
officer of King Charles
and governor of Cuba?

598
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,236
Or would you prefer I call the army
to haul you back in chains?

599
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,995
Ah, of course I shall comply
with this order.

600
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,208
Tell me, how would you care to join us
on a secret mission?

601
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,209
What do you say, hmm?

602
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,586
Very well.

603
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,422
I couldn't ask for more.

604
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,140
What else do you require, my lord?

605
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,933
Fear.

606
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:52,262
Thank you for agreeing to make
the offerings before we begin our trials.

607
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,264
Yes.

608
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,807
It's the right thing to do.

609
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,517
Do you remember how to say it?

610
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,144
Tlacatlé,

611
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,730
totecoé Tzinacan.

612
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,607
Oh, thank the gods.

613
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,776
I thought that I had failed you, my lord.

614
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,488
- I, who am just but a humble--
- Acatzin...

615
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,782
other than my father,

616
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,827
you are without a doubt
the best man I've ever known.

617
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:20,083
I feel like Tzinacan would smile
if he saw me leap into the fray.

618
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,669
Don't you think?

619
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,590
I'm grateful
you finally accepted your destiny.

620
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,885
Break your backs
if that's what will get it up there.

621
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,596
Pull!

622
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,809
Excellent work, gentlemen. Take a break.

623
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,062
Nature calls.

624
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,487
On your feet, you vermin!
We're under attack!

625
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,705
Quick! Put it out!

626
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:12,801
Bravo. I see that you've made
a few improvements.

627
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,762
You took the words right out of my mouth.

628
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:40,245
Was this mission
supposed to show me your abilities?

629
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:44,541
Too few of you understand
what Almighty God has given me.

630
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,669
The opportunity to finally sit
on a throne.

631
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,672
A throne? Just the one in a Cuban jail
where you shall face judgment.

632
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,133
He has also told me

633
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:57,388
my hands control the power of destiny.

634
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,726
Hmm. Fate can be cruel.

635
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,061
By the Lord and his saints, you're--

636
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,605
You're a monster!

637
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,363
Goddamn you!

638
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,866
It was the Bat!

639
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,368
He was the one
who murdered Diego's messenger.

640
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,663
I shall see you're avenged, my friend.

641
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,373
Leave him there. Let's return to the city.

642
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,418
You'll need
some new armor first, captain.

643
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,378
Some new armor.

644
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,550
And a new strategy.

645
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,269
It's outrageous!

646
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,606
To be waylaid like this
on an excursion through the forest.

647
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,191
My men and I, we come in peace.

648
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,485
But I answer to King Charles,

649
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:57,323
and he is not nearly as merciful
as my God is.

650
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,200
But why not inform me
you all were leaving the city?

651
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,327
And why were you in the forest at night?

652
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,372
That's not what's important here.
We were attacked.

653
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:11,920
For this reason, I humbly request
the Sun King accompany us

654
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,297
to avoid any future attacks.

655
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,469
I will go with you
as compensation for your losses, sir.

656
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,263
Please, if you would accept,

657
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:24,307
I wish for you and your men
to be my guests of honor

658
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,352
at our Tóxcatl festival.

659
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,145
Your Highness is too generous.

660
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,107
I'd like to do my part
to avoid future misunderstandings

661
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:36,278
and to promote a better understanding
between both of our peoples.

662
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,239
I'd be very eager to hear your proposal.

663
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,700
Huey tlatoani, I volunteer in your stead

664
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,286
to be companion
to the esteemed Captain Cortés.

665
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:47,163
I'll answer his questions
and learn with him,

666
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,416
and from him.

667
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,712
Very well. Our war leader
shall accompany you henceforth.

668
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,065
I gave my life to the king!

669
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,735
To our people!

670
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,028
How am I repaid?

671
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,614
With humiliation and disgrace.

672
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:23,533
Show Moctezuma his mistake.

673
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,038
He must see just how immaculate you are.

674
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:31,125
That your faith is pure and undeniable.

675
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,501
Yes. My faith.

676
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,295
With all of its power,

677
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,506
it will drive away Cortés
and that citlālim popōca.

678
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,635
Precisely.

679
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,762
Such zealous ingenuity

680
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,557
is why you are my chosen one.

681
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:55,774
Do you also believe that the citlāl-pōca
up in the sky predicts misfortune?

682
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:59,612
I think its appearance,
alongside your arrival,

683
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,404
is not a good sign.

684
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,950
We also used to believe that the comet,
the name we call it,

685
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,868
was the portent of a bad omen.

686
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,286
TLATELOLCO'S MARKET

687
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,206
But today we know
it's simply a floating ball of gas

688
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,625
revolving around our world
in the cosmos,

689
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,586
just like the sun and the moon.

690
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,465
Are you saying you believe
the sun revolves around this world?

691
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,800
It's been proven.

692
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,302
You don't think so as well?

693
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,930
No.

694
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,890
Our people have known for many suns now

695
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,519
that this world
isn't the center of anything.

696
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,897
Well, if you know so much...

697
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:40,026
then why didn't you all
discover us before we discovered you?

698
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,529
Your people already have your own magic,

699
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,072
your own world.

700
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,907
What exactly do you want from us?

701
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,618
Oh, it doesn't matter how much you have,

702
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,287
because you can always
have something more.

703
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,541
Isn't it important
how you go about getting it?

704
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,794
Does your god approve the slaughter
of women and children?

705
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,673
In this world, our souls shall be tested.

706
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:04,175
The more difficult
the test we face becomes,

707
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,344
the more pure we shall be as a result.

708
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,722
That is not...

709
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,806
That's not an answer.

710
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,849
The sad reality

711
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,978
is that sometimes a leader will be forced
to make some decisions that are difficult.

712
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,481
But what if those decisions they make
are wrong?

713
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:25,114
When that happens,
I'll make sure you're the first to know.

714
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,539
Come here, my love! I want a hug!

715
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,917
Give me a big hug!

716
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,127
How I've missed you, my son.

717
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,254
Oh, it's been far too long.

718
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,466
I'm so happy
that you've finally come back home.

719
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,843
Yoka, come. Come. Come in.

720
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,179
Come in. Come in.

721
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,144
Why so serious?

722
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:59,398
You've always smiled
since you were little.

723
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:04,445
The work of the gods
is a serious matter, Mother.

724
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,281
You saw citlālim popōca?

725
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,201
It appeared the same day as Cortés
and all of his soldiers.

726
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,288
And if we fail in our duty
to feed the gods,

727
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,332
it shall spell doom for our people.

728
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,629
Now I must ask you, Mother...

729
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,341
to put your trust in me.

730
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:27,927
Are you certain?

731
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,138
Moctezuma also agrees with you?

732
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,556
You're sure this is the right thing?

733
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,058
Yes.

734
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,066
Then we place our faith
in your hands, Yoka.

735
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,529
Without any risk,
there would be no reward.

736
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,073
This festival shall be the perfect moment.

737
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,699
You will be in charge.

738
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,701
The plan hinges on you.

739
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,829
So don't screw it up.

740
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,123
If we were to call
upon the Tlaxcaltecas,

741
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,583
then we wouldn't need
to divide our forces like this.

742
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,585
And why would you share with someone,

743
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,841
when you might easily have it
all for yourself, Pedro?

744
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,220
This way, we kill two birds
with one stone.

745
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,394
Am I interrupting?

746
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,604
No. Perfect timing.

747
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,815
We received some stupendous news just now,

748
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,859
and we're planning a surprise
for your people.

749
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,820
You do all enjoy surprises, hmm?

750
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,614
Well, that all depends on the surprise.

751
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,783
What did you say?

752
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,368
Nothing.

753
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,078
Hmm. Right.

754
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,790
Pardon me. I must go get ready.

755
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,669
Tonight things shall take
quite a radical turn.

756
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,382
Citlālim popōca's still there.

757
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,925
Cortés is still armed.

758
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,219
He taunts you at every turn.

759
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,513
Oh, he isn't taunting me,

760
00:57:55,514 --> 00:58:00,686
for it's been I
that's taunted you since the start.

761
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,229
What are you saying, Huitzilopochtli?

762
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,108
I am not Huitzilopochtli.

763
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,405
Tezcatlipoca?

764
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,490
Wretched deceiver!

765
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,577
But don't worry,
for you're still my chosen one.

766
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:23,082
Providing ways of testing people like you
is why I exist in the first place.

767
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,501
But what have I done to be punished so?

768
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,756
You were always far too eager
to dismiss the idea of your own sacrifice,

769
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,634
because you are nothing.

770
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,509
You're no one.

771
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,969
It must all be a dream.

772
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,638
It's only a nightmare.

773
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,973
Only a nightmare. Yes, yes.

774
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,516
Oh, and, you know,

775
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,061
your mother really had a point.

776
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,939
You should smile more, Yoka.

777
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,076
How can I earn your forgiveness?

778
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,912
What? Mother? Is that you?

779
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,248
Tell me.

780
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,582
Ohh.

781
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,878
Yes, I will, Mother.

782
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,297
I will make sure I enjoy life.

783
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,550
And smile. I promise.

784
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,177
I promise.

785
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,216
You're mine.

786
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:31,086
TÓXCATL'S FESTIVAL

787
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,609
Do you want blood? I shall give you blood.

788
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,487
Calm down, Pedro.

789
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,908
I knew it was you in there, Yohualli.

790
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,701
I could sense you.

791
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,080
I saw it in the way
that you forged metal.

792
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,123
But I couldn't be certain.

793
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,293
That is, until I heard you quote the words
of your father.

794
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,629
Good. Now you won't be surprised

795
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,714
when I end your terror.

796
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:19,842
You are truly one hell of a warrior.

797
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:24,555
Too bad you aren't back in the city
to defend Moctezuma.

798
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,935
He could use the help
of someone of your talents

799
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:31,729
when we pay him a visit tonight.

800
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,856
No.

801
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:42,156
Yes. Did you think
this circus we put on here

802
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,783
was about you?

803
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,537
My friend, despite our history,

804
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:50,541
you are nothing but my dessert.

805
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,319
You wretched bastard.

806
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,490
The captain's not going to like this.

807
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,783
MASSACRE IN THE GREAT TEMPLE

808
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,953
They started it. Now clean that filth up.

809
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:42,842
Well... there you are, Your Highness.

810
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,387
You wanted a festival of blood.
Well, there you have it.

811
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,139
Hold him there.

812
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,892
And kill the others.

813
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,520
What have I done?

814
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,237
No!

815
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,071
Kill him!

816
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,159
The Bat Demon has finally come!
Keep shooting!

817
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,745
Fire!

818
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,875
Seal those damn doors already.

819
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,510
"Without him, you don't exist."

820
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:29,138
She meant Tzinacan, not Cortés.

821
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,683
Acatzin, you and my tahtli
have been right all along.

822
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,895
Cortés is the bull.
And the Bat God is who protects me.

823
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,524
How could I not see it sooner?
I'm such an idiot.

824
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,074
The horn of the king. He's summoning us.

825
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,743
Maybe he escaped.

826
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,829
I don't think that's the king.
I can only hope that we're not too late.

827
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,415
Did my father leave any gold?

828
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,232
How dare they lay hands on the king?

829
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,319
The life of your beloved king

830
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,282
depends on how well
you all behave yourselves.

831
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:34,079
Your own warriors will be in charge
of making sure you vermin comply.

832
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,873
What I want is gold.

833
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,085
Not one piece or two.

834
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,463
You see, I want all of it.

835
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,882
All of the gold there is.

836
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,552
I want it now!

837
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,808
Yes.

838
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,020
This is exactly what I desire.

839
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,688
Yes.

840
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,444
For the love of Moctezuma!

841
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:09,990
No, stay back.
We don't want to have to hurt you.

842
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,994
Yes.

843
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,538
More.

844
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:18,915
More!

845
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,460
I want it all!

846
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:32,845
Why didn't you do it? Vengeance was yours.
It was within your grasp.

847
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,931
Because what happens here depends
on something far greater than me.

848
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,894
Cortés must stand and face our justice,
not my vengeance.

849
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:41,395
What's your plan, then?

850
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,482
Our warriors won't be able to fight.

851
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,317
Not while the king is being held prisoner.

852
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,361
That's why I have to free him.

853
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:50,030
Huh. How easy.

854
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,340
Nice shrine.

855
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,510
Better make that last prayer count.

856
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:18,975
- I'll go get the weapons ready.
- Bring all of them.

857
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,477
- You came here to help me?
- No.

858
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,479
- Just to say farewell.
- Farewell?

859
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,939
And that's all?

860
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,858
Don't get me wrong,
you're quite interesting.

861
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,735
But not enough to risk death.

862
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,862
Not when so many people
still depend on me.

863
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,075
I understand. I have to go and get ready.

864
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:39,412
I'm sure what you're planning to do
is probably insane.

865
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,915
But that doesn't mean it can't be
something pure and selfless either.

866
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,583
To catch a glimpse of that is rare.

867
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,462
I wanted to see it and wish you the best.

868
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,381
Thank you.

869
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:17,075
I beg you, Tzinacan,
spare me from your vengeance.

870
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,661
Pardon this bastard disgrace
of an emperor.

871
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,331
I thought I saw a god
where there was nothing but death.

872
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,001
Now I don't know what to do.

873
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:30,087
Cortés and his soldiers are not gods.

874
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,048
They're evil men who must be stopped.

875
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:36,135
Summon your warriors.
Tell them to rise and fight back.

876
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,181
Yes, O powerful Tzinacan.

877
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:51,317
Your sacrifice won't be for naught,
nor will your armor.

878
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,283
Move it! Hurry up!

879
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,243
What did I tell you, Pedro?

880
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,704
You told me that we would be rich

881
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,040
and that, after all the bribes
had been made,

882
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,418
we would all live like kings.

883
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,506
If I see one more feather...

884
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:17,052
No more useless bird feathers!

885
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:23,308
Or I'll hang your king next to all those
who've dared provoke my anger!

886
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,776
Captain, we have to get out of here
right now.

887
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,281
Ahuaque tepehuaque, I have a message!

888
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:43,160
One that I heard directly!
It's from Tzinacan himself!

889
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,956
Listen! Listen to me, I beg you!

890
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,457
I know I've failed you,

891
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,377
that I've made mistakes,
but the Bat God has visited me--

892
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:04,182
It seems you've lost the trust
of your people, my lord.

893
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,059
Fear not.

894
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,187
There's one way
you may still help the cause.

895
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,985
And that's with your death.

896
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:21,657
Your fear is the reason

897
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,119
your empire dies with you.

898
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,464
The teúles have slain Moctezuma.

899
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,348
Huey tlatoani has been murdered.

900
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:49,852
Now our plans have been ruined, you fools!

901
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:53,022
'Tis nothing our swords cannot remedy,
my captain.

902
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,941
To the palace. Until more troops arrive.

903
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,711
Just 50 meters more.

904
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,548
This is war, gentlemen. Give them hell!

905
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:29,935
Ocelotl!

906
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,311
At your service, great Tzinacan.

907
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:35,607
The horn. Summon all of our warriors. Now.

908
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,497
O great and powerful Bat God,

909
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:54,417
grant me a weapon
that may vanquish the pale invaders.

910
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,671
Tzinacan, here are the weapons.

911
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,970
Never again.
Not one shall set foot in these halls!

912
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,389
They shall not take this sacred throne!

913
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,478
Attack!

914
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,461
Cortés!

915
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:48,722
- I am going to end you.
- Let's finish this.

916
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,274
Get the cannon ready! Load it and fire!

917
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:04,904
Fire!

918
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:13,997
It is inevitable, Yohualli.

919
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,208
There always must be a loser.

920
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,048
Fire!

921
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,192
You were saying?

922
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,651
Yes.

923
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,280
I was saying...

924
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:53,745
...that God Almighty himself
always safeguards my victory.

925
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:59,793
Now let's see if your gods
move a single finger for you!

926
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:31,198
In case you were wondering
what all of that wood we cut down was for.

927
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:36,746
All that remains
is to leave it up to fate.

928
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,044
Damn you!

929
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,262
For Huitzilopochtli!

930
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,767
Fire!

931
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,278
On all I hold sacred,
I will destroy this city.

932
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:13,074
I am your new god now!

933
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,038
I knew you'd come back.

934
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,584
Oh, really? I didn't.

935
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,378
My lord, you're wounded!

936
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,881
It's just a scratch.

937
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:33,928
- Did you do as I asked?
- I placed it at the top of the temple.

938
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,187
All you have to do
is jump off this wall?

939
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:44,855
- I mean, you're joking me, right?
- No.

940
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,358
I followed what
all of their writings said.

941
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:53,614
It'll work. I've got to try.

942
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:55,908
Are you sure
you'll be able to pull this off?

943
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:58,327
A little blood
has never stopped me before.

944
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,335
Here, for good luck.

945
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,976
I knew it! He is the chosen one!

946
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,315
Tzinacan is here!

947
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:31,194
The Bat God has come
to fight alongside us!

948
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,282
They've invoked
an infernal winged demon!

949
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,201
Impossible.

950
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,629
Come on. I know we can pull through.

951
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,398
Gunners, load. And fire!

952
01:16:56,446 --> 01:17:00,742
Don't stop shooting, soldiers of God!
Slaughter them all!

953
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,162
Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan.

954
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,955
I know I should've been a better servant,

955
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:10,042
but please permit me
to see my mission through,

956
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,002
and I'll submit to your power

957
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:13,796
and take the path to Mictlán.

958
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,843
Fire!

959
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,678
No!

960
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,808
Axcan kema, tehuatl, nehuatl!

961
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:39,781
What?

962
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,916
Now is our moment!
Let's break their skulls!

963
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:55,338
For Tenochtitlán!

964
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:12,355
I will make you bow to me!

965
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,649
I'd rather die!

966
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:25,325
Those wounds look dire.
You won't last much longer.

967
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:28,037
I've got long enough
to bring you to justice.

968
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,094
Huh?

969
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,989
No, no!

970
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,159
No!

971
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,398
Citlālim popōca's gone!

972
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:42,235
- The ill omen has ended!
- The gods have granted us mercy!

973
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:45,031
We have been blessed
by the blood of the dead!

974
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,924
Am I not your chosen one?

975
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:08,428
Why have you forsaken me, Lord?

976
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,388
Why did I fail?

977
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,099
This can't be it.

978
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:16,854
Captain, perhaps we could improve
our strategy to take the city?

979
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,982
Send a message to Xicotencatl,

980
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:23,027
the leader of the Tlaxcaltecas.

981
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:26,613
Tell him that he and I must speak.

982
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:31,035
And repeat
the same stupid mistakes,

983
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,369
captain?

984
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,542
I will...

985
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,462
make the throne yours.

986
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:52,640
Look at you.

987
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,063
Such a fool.
Look at what you've done.

988
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,691
A wise man told me once...

989
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,193
"Fear can kill you

990
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,821
or inspire you to action."

991
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,947
I'm glad I was there to save you.

992
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:11,450
You shouldn't have sacrificed
yourself like that.

993
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,666
Fate leaves me with no regrets.

994
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,293
Well...

995
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,629
maybe there's one thing I'll regret.

996
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:28,634
My boy.

997
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:01,875
Now rest in peace, Yohualli Coatl.

998
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:04,795
Young Shadow of Chief Toltecatzin.

999
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,799
Tzinacan's chosen one
and sacred Bat Protector.

1000
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,843
Rest in peace.

1001
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,182
Sleep until Quetzalcoatl...

1002
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,643
our creator,

1003
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:22,855
decides that he needs you back
in this world.

1004
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,803
- Do you think this is over?
- No.

1005
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,098
I fear there's far more evil to come.
