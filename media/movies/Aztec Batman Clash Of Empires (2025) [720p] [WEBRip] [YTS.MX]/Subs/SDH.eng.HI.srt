[man] Another vision?

29
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,037
A nightmare, I'd say.
Must have been that old huitlacoche I ate.

30
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,583
Ah, I've never known you
to eat old huitlacoche, my son.

31
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,878
Especially so many times in a row.

32
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,504
It's nothing, Papa. Just the corn.

Don't you ever ignore your dreams, Yohu,
no matter where they come from.

Now, then, if it was nothing,

You will give our Bat God
the respect that he is due.

40

Even your mother
would not have blamed him.

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,783
Her death was not his fault.

42
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,580
But he also didn't lift a finger
to save her.

43
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,916
Even when we prayed
with the utmost respect.

44

She's watching over you. You know that.

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,129
Yes, Pa. I know.

46
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,215
Your mother's got her eye on you
right next to Tzinacan.

47

Now don't forget, son,
your training isn't a game,

Shields!

63
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,369
They are your best defense.
Now show me your side-kick.

64
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,708
Yohu! And hold. Don't move a muscle.

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,877
The position of your arm
needs to be higher.

66
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,880
Or your strike will completely lack power.

67
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,135
All right. Let's continue.

68
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,682
I know how difficult it was for you
after the death of your mother,

69
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,475
but now that you're grown up,

70
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,894
it's time you get serious
about your future.

71
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,355
Don't scold me, please.

72
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,025
When you take my place,

73
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,861
it'll be your duty
to always be ready for battle

74
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,531
and, when your people need you,
to serve them as best you can.

75
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:28,120
Remember, fear can kill you
or inspire you to action.

76
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,954
It's your call.

77
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,497
You're-- You--

78
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,583
- [foreboding music playing]
- What are those?

79
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,252
[woman] Look! Mountains carried by clouds!

80
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,547
[man] No. Those are monsters
from the depths.

81
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,675
[music turns ominous, militaristic]

82
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,655
They look like they're gods.

83
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,866
Listen carefully to what they say, Yohu,

84
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,202
but pay closer attention to how they act.

85
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,955
That's how you can tell
if they're gods or not.

86
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,549
[Spanish guitar cadence plays,
then music fades out]

87
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,551
Mm.

88
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,637
Mm.

89
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,846
I salute you, blessed people.

90
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,057
I am Captain Hernán Cortés.

91
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,434
I've come to your lands
in the name of Almighty God

92
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,977
and the Holy Roman Emperor,

93
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,898
His Majesty Charles I,
the king of Castilla.

94
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,819
I am Chief Toltecatzin,
first son of Oquitzin.

95
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,029
May I ask the reason you come?

96
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,990
I am exploring the New World.

97
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,493
You found a new world?

98
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,079
The vast green landscape
stretching out before us,

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,998
it's called the New World
since we only just discovered it.

100
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,169
Many suns have already passed
since our people first knew these lands.

[tense music playing]

102
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,590
We seem to find ourselves low on supplies.

[tense music spikes]

104
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,096
Would you be willing to make a trade?

105
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,305
No.

106
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,599
No?

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,563
Our village has plenty that we can share.

108
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,898
Join us. You shall be our honored guests.

109
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,154
[laughs] That is excellent.
What a splendid idea.

110
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,826
[villagers murmuring]

111
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,621
[grunts]

112
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,127
My lord, I don't trust
these pale strangers one iota.

113
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,672
They act as if this village
now belongs to them.

114
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,257
I understand your frustration,
old warrior.

115
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,093
Tonight I'll consult
the judgment of the gods.

116
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,554
We shall let them decide.

117
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,931
[woman] Want another? We have plenty.

118
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,268
Diego sent us here to get gold,
not to fill our bellies.

119
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,979
- [cup shatters]
- And he'll get it, once we discover--

120
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,857
Your fabled city swimming in gold?

121
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:07,028
Gold is what makes Diego
and the authorities happy.

122
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,907
My plans with God
are far more grand than such riches.

123
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,994
[foreboding music builds, then fades out]

124
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,415
I would like to thank you all
for this warm welcome.

125
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,252
Allow me to show you
some of the wonders of my world.

126
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,463
Inventions, ideas,

127
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,506
from some of our brightest minds.

128
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,469
- Behold!
- [crowd gasping]

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,558
- [gasps]
- And this is Toledo,

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,188
the most glorious city in Castilla,
the land where I come from.

131
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,981
I've heard your capital is beautiful.

132
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,359
- Tenochtitlán?
- "Tenochtitlán."

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Oh, thank you.

134
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,697
- I want to say it right when I get there.
- [chuckles]

135
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,493
And finally, this is an arquebus,

136
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,538
or, as some Mexicas already know it...

137
00:08:59,164 --> 00:08:59,998
[all yell]

138
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,792
[all gasp]

139
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,379
...the thunder of the gods!

140
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:10,091
- Time for bed, Young Shadow.
- But it's still light out, Tahtli.

141
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,886
Your father is right.
Enough talk for today.

142
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,638
Until tomorrow, Chief Toltecatzin.

143
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,807
Rest well, Young Yohualli.

144
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,893
[foreboding music playing]

145
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,107
And their armor looks so shiny,
almost like the skin of a fish,

146
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,236
and yet it seems also like it's as hard
as a turtle shell.

147
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,197
And their writings possess magic.

148
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,783
One even showed how to fly like a bird.

149
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,703
Is it possible? To fly?

150
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,747
[serene music playing]

151
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,545
Again you're asking for advice
from Tzinacan?

152
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,715
I pray for guidance and for answers.

153
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,718
I believe that they do look like gods.

154
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,510
They're not gods.

155
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,097
But if it's Tezcatlipoca who advises them,

156
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,975
then they might be as devious
as they are powerful.

157
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,936
In that case,
then wouldn't that make them gods?

158
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,563
Do you remember Acatzin?

159
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,149
The one who watches
over our house in the city?

160
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,484
I think so, yeah.

161
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,362
- Do you think that Cortés--?
- Enough with Cortés. [sighs]

162
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,491
Please, if something bad happens to me,
go find Acatzin, and he will help.

163
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,994
Yes, Pa.

164
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,041
[eerie flute music playing]

165
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,338

00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,096
Pa?

[uneasy music playing]

169
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,063
[thunder rumbling]

170
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,898
[woman] What was that? Thunder?

171
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,567
- [child] I'm scared, Mama.
- Huh?

172
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,819
- [thunder crashes]
- [ominous music spikes]

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,072
[gasps]

174
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,828
- What is it, Father?
- For now, nothing. Keep quiet, though.

175
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,631
Chief Toltecatzin, we are grateful
for your generous hospitality.

176
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,715
It was nothing.

177
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,594
What might be nothing to some people
can be everything to others.

178
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,847
That's why my men and I
require a little bit more from you.

179
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,392
The location of Tenochtitlán.

180
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,770
Impossible. We have strict rules
in place that forbid this.

181
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,107
Rules are rules. Hmm.

182
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,608
Ah. How about this idea?

183
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,194
What if you joined our expedition
and showed us?

184
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,448
Even better, Yohu could be my herald
and announce my arrival to the Sun King.

185
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,409
- Yes.
- That's out of the question.

186
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,120
Father, please. I can do it.

187
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,206
The boy is more than old enough
to make his own decisions,

188
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,541
don't you think?

189
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,336
Captain Cortés speaks the truth.
I'm a grown man.

190
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,463
That's what you said.

191
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,716
Listen close, son.

192
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,137
If anything happens,
you run and go straight to Acatzin.

193
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,723
Take your mother as well.
She'll protect you.

194
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,400
[villagers gasps]

195
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,403
[man] Do you see his hair?
How it shines like the sun?

196
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,197
Is he a god, Mama?

197
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,908
Tonatiuh.

198
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,119
[gasps]

199
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,372
- Tonatiuh.
- Tonatiuh is here.

200
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,336
I will personally request for an audience
on your behalf with Moctezuma.

201
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,006
Meanwhile, you shall wait in our village
as our guests of honor.

202
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:41,636
Ah, it's best to arrive unannounced.
Besides, everybody loves surprises.

203
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,264
Well, that all depends on the surprise.

204
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,894
So you still don't trust me, hmm?

205
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,189
You have nothing to fear.
We're Christians. We are here to help you.

206
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,523
- [whinnies]
- [man] The gods!

207
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,652
- [woman] The gods have arrived!
- Back, or I'll kill you.

208
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,782
[ominous music playing]

209
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,411
This is help in your world? No!

210
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,042
None of you strangers are gods!
You're nothing but liars and murderers!

211
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,834
[thunder crashes]

212
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:19,549
As long as I draw breath,
you'll never see Tenochtitlán.

213
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,969
[laughs] Fine.

214
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,264
Thank you for such wise counsel.

215
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,351
- [ominous music spikes]
- [gasps]

216
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,189
[Yohu breathing shakily]

217
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,732
[all gasp, then grunt]

218
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,527
[thunder crashes]

219
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,113
Slaughter them all!

220
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,783
[all yelling]

221
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,452

[sobs]

224
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,885
Tahtli!

225
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,221
Papa!

226
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,100
Pa. I'm sorry.

227
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,019
- [music turns ominous]
- That decides it.

228
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,855
You're coming with me now.

229
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,483
[yelps]

230
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,946
Filthy wretch!

231

[yells]

[bat shrieking]

234
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,940
[music fades out]

235
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,162
[Poison Ivy in echoey voice]
It courses through your veins.

236
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,999
It runs through your body.

237
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,420
Mama?

238
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,339
[Yohu groans]

239
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,050
- [Poison Ivy] Through all of our bodies.
- [yells]

240
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,719
[Poison Ivy] You must fight...

241
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,263
or die.

242
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,848
Fight...

243
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,476
and die.

244
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,602
Your life...

245
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,771
it must be in balance.

246
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,938
[yells]

247
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,483
Our world...

248
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,986
must also be in balance.

249
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,157
- [shrieks]
- [yells]

250
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,366

- [vines rustling]
- Huh?

252
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,000
[grunts]

253
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,304
[ethereal music playing]

254
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,767
No, he isn't ready yet.

255
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,435
Give him a test, you say?

256
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,938
Hmm. Perhaps.

257
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,606
Excuse me.

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,566
Is this Mictlán?

259
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,485
No. You aren't dead.

260
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,195
Not yet.

261
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,447
Then what is...? Please, I have to leave.

262
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,949
Which way is the path...

263
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,701
[ethereal music swells]

264
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,786
...to...?

265
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,830
What is that?

266
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,833
What you witnessed will come true.

267
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,752
But not all of what you saw
has come to pass yet.

268
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,129
There's time.

269
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,340
Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

270
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,094
- What is this place?
- It's the beginning for you...

271
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,929
and the end.

272
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,225
- It wouldn't be wise to say any more.
- You crazy witch.

273
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,944
[grunting]

274
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,907
[music turns eerie]

00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,376
[water dripping]

276
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,424
Huh?

277
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,137
[grunting]

278
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,767
- [eerie music spikes]
- [yells]

279
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,940
It's you.

280
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,650
You, who let my mother die.

281
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,986
Did you see what they did to my father?

282
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,362
To my village?

283
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,950
How is this a balance of justice?
You have done nothing!

284
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,953
That's because you're a lie!

285
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,165
[whimpers]

286
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,167

288
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,675
Help me! Get them off! Get them off!

289
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,468
What is this?

290
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,929
[yells]

291
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,476

292
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,102
Huh?

00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,605
[mystical music playing]

294
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,822
[steady percussive music playing]

295
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,911
[groaning softly]

00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,053
- [music stops]
- [panting]

297
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:03,643
I can give you a little food,
but I told you, you cannot sleep here.

298
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,603
Yohualli?

299
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,148
Are you all right? Where's your father?

300
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,194
[sobs] Acatzin!

301
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,905
- [melancholy music playing]
- [sobbing]

302
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,867
Oh, my dear Yohu.

303
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:26,582
MOCTEZUMA'S PALACE

304
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
You're not alone, Yohu.

305
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,837
I've been at your side
since the day you were born.

306
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,926
You're saying you were robbed
by a Jaguar God?

307
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,468
That's absurd.

308
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,555
Try telling that to my guards
with the scars on their faces.

309
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,141
It slashed them all with its flying claws.

310
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,476
This isn't the first time
it's stolen from us either.

311
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,105
[solemn music playing]

312
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,361
This humble servant comes
before Your Eminence

313
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,072
to present his new lord, Yohualli Coatl,

314
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,534
son of Chief Toltecatzin
from the Smoking Village.

315
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,330
Is this the young man
who saw the teúles and their leader?

316
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,499
Yes, I am the one, high priest,
that saw them.

317
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,670
You may speak,
Little Lord of the Forest.

318
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:18,550
Huey Tlatoani Moctezuma II is listening.

319
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:23,264
Their leader, he calls himself
Captain Hernán Cortés.

320
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,309
He came into our village with soldiers.

321
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,104
- My father, he shared food with them--
- What else happened?

322
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,150
Cortés wanted to know
how to find Tenochtitlán.

323
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,902
Hmm? Hmm.

324
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,279
[Yohu] My father refused.

325
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,157
Cortés murdered him,

326
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,909
then slew my whole village.

327
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,788
But not you? You must run fast, then.

328
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,209
Cortés seems to behave
the same way gods act towards men.

329
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,463
Sometimes he will be kind.
Other times, cruel.

330
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,840
What's your take on this,
High Priest Yoka?

331
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,343
Are they men or are they gods?

332
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,514
Gods, Your Eminence.

333
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,350
And we should invite them here
to prevent them from getting angry.

334
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,853
- No!
- Silence, you little--

335
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,271
Go ahead, young one.

336
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,402
Cortés is not a god.
But he is a powerful and cruel man.

337
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,237
He must be stopped
before he sets foot in this city.

338
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:24,199
This boy from the provinces
is but a simple warrior.

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,202
What gift was he endowed

340
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,331
to know who is or isn't a god?

341
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,544
Please, my lord,
I beg you to heed my words.

342
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,629
We shall test their capabilities.

343
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,591
Although, if they were gods,
they'd get here on their own.

344
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,435
[growls]

345
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,648
He has no idea how dangerous Cortés is.

346
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,236
I believe you,
but Yoka is the city's high priest.

347
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,446
He speaks directly to the gods.

348
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,697
He knows them.

349
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,493
The gods don't need to use weapons
when they come to take your head.

350
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,955
- What are you talking about, Yohualli?
- Cortés murdered my father.

351
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,957
He spoke of my right to seek revenge.

352
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,127
At your age, no one expects you
to take such rash action.

353
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,464
Avenging my tahtli isn't rash action.

354
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,674
- It's my debt.
- No, it's not.

355
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:27,096
You don't understand.
I wouldn't listen. I wasn't ready to.

356
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,891
I let fear take control.

357
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,935
I vow never to make that mistake again.

358
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,646
I want you to train me
to become the greatest warrior

359
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,356
that the world has ever known.

360
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,194
I'm to going to stop Cortés
and his soldiers.

361
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,988
Your wish is my command, my lord.

362
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,864
[foreboding music playing]

363
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,283
[Yoka] Damn that Yohu!

364
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,536
The prophecies are certain!

365
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,998
[grunts angrily] Insolent forest whelp!

366
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:01,631
Tlacatlé, totecoé Huitzilopochtli!

367
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,719
Tlacatlé, totecoé Huitzilopochtli!

368
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,475
[Huitzilopochtli] Is that doubt I sense?

369
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:17,939
No, I would never. I'd never doubt you.

370
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,315
But what of the king?

371
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:24,529
Are you saying you doubt yourself, Yoka?

372
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,198
Make him see.

373
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,997
- [Yohu grunting]
- [weapons thumping]

374
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,793
[winces]

375
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,710
And again.

376
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,588
[grim music playing]

377
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,929
[grunts, then pants]

378
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:51,973
And again.

379
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,771
And again.

380
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,152
[yells]

381
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,948
And again.

382
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,245
[music turns ominous]

383
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,497
[screams]

384
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,294
[grim music playing]

385
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,677
[pants] Hmm.

386
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,097
[grim music continues]

387
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,143
ALLIANCE WITH TLAXCALTECAS

388
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:47,028
CHOLULA MASSACRE

389
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,199
[all grunting, yelling]

390
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,539
[music turns solemn]

391
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,927
[solemn music continues]

392
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,811
[birds screaming]

393
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,857
- The teúles are at our door.
- Just as I predicted.

394
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,484
Nothing will hinder them,

395
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,862
for they are gods,
and they deserve our welcome.

396
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,406
And you, Yohualli Coatl?

397
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,451
What do you think?
Will it be impossible to stop them?

398
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,161
Give me the order, great king.

399
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,331
My warriors and I are more than ready
to test them in combat.

400
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,376
- [warriors yelling in unison]
- [man] Death to the pale invaders!

401
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,920
We'll push them back into the sea!

402
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,464
He's insane, Your Majesty.

403
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,092
It's a fool's errand
to wage war against the gods.

404
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,262
Huey tlatoani,
these intruders are not gods.

405
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,639
I swear upon the blood of my parents.

406
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,266
I have much to think over.

407
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:03,688
In any case, I expect you to be prepared,
regardless of my decision.

408
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,903
CORTÉS ARRIVES IN TENOCHTITLÁN

409
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,739
Look. A silver metropolis.

410
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,574
It's even bigger than Toledo.

411
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,952
[laughs] What did I say, Pedro?

412
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,789
That we'd soon find
their hidden metropolis.

413
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,374
And finally, we are here!

414
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,793
[laughs menacingly]

415
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,837
There must be a mountain of gold
and riches within.

416
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,507
But we won't know until we're inside.

417
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,428
Let us make for the city gates.

418
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,307
[foreboding music playing]

419
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,817
I salute you, O blessed people.

420
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,319
I am Captain Hernán Cortés.

421
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
[music fades out]

422
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:57,449
I'm here in the name of God
and King Charles I of Castilla.

423
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,993
I humbly ask permission to enter

424
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,955
so I may share the many wonders
of my world with you.

425
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,380
[eerie music playing]

426
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:17,052
Persuade the king
that he must open the gates to the teúles.

427
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,222
Yohualli Coatl clouded his judgment
with foolhardy counsel.

428
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,185
Tloque Nahuaque ,
Yohualli Ehecatl, Ipalnemohuani!

429
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,853
He refuses to listen.

430
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,939
If it's what I desire, he will listen.

431
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,237
[laughs coldly]
You are my voice on earth, son. Go.

432
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,075
Huey tlatoani, I beg you,

433
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,411
please welcome the teúles into the city.

434
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,373
[tense music playing]

435
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,469
The time is nigh. Rise, gentlemen!

436
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,180
Time to claim what's ours!

437
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,099
[soldiers shout]

438
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,061
- [soldier 1] Show no mercy.
- [soldier 2] Kill every last one.

439
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,398
Tell us, war leader,
what are your orders?

440
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,691
Allow them inside.

441
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,861
[conch trumpeting]

442
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,784
[ominous music playing]

443
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,985
[gasps]

444
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,834
We're entering into the lion's den.

445
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,627
Everything will be all right.

446
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,505
How do you know this?
Did the Lord tell you?

447
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,882
Yes.

448
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,759
Every morning, I hear from him on high.

449
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,431
"Hernán, it is all in your hands."

450
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,440
[music quiets, turns suspenseful]

451
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,278
Hmm.

452
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,952
[both gasp]

453
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,998
Yoka, why are they not satisfied
by our many sacrifices and offerings?

454
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,416
[Yoka] They look like teúles.

455
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,462
Perhaps they wish us
to present them with different gifts.

456
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,267
Is it you?

457
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,896
- Are you...? Are you Moctezuma?
- Yes.

458
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,981
I am Moctezuma.

459
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,691
Welcome to our city, my lord.

460
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,318
Take your rightful throne.

461
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,946
I've watched over it
for you all this time.

462
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:27,825
My predecessors Itzcoatl,
Moctezuma I and Axayácatl

463
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,746
all proclaimed that one day
you'd come for what's yours.

464
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,998
And today is the day.

465
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,878
Welcome, at long last,
to your destined land.

466
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,588
[crowd gasps]

467
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,175
I'm Hernán Cortés,
first emissary of God

468
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,137
and the Holy Roman Emperor,
King Charles I.

469
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,556
- You think they're Gods?
- The king will know.

470
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,933
I've come all this way
to show you the many wonders...

471
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:52,976
He touched the king!

472
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,478
[crowd murmuring]

473
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,189
- It's forbidden to touch him!
- The gods would never do such a thing!

474
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,109
Uh, would you like, O great king,

475
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,486
for us to speak in a place
that's a bit more...?

476
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,029
- See that, child?
- Citlālim popōca!

477
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,656
The teúles used their godlike powers

478
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,492
to cause citlālim popōca
to appear in the sky!

479
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,327
- [man 1] In the sky!
- [man 2] It's a sign.

480
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,997
- What is it, Hernán?
- Be on your guard.

481
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,125
No! Not the end!
How could you have missed this?

482
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,336
Was it because--
Because I delayed in welcoming Cortés?

483
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,756
Or because I allowed him in?
Why does the end approach us? Yoka!

484
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,636
Great and powerful king, I...
I don't know.

485
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,479
[solemn woodwind music playing]

486
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,899
[Acatzin] Tzinacan, protect this city.

487
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,113
Help our people survive
this great calamity--

488
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,823
Are you going somewhere? At this hour?

489
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,783
Cortés won't sit on his hands
and do nothing.

490
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,201
He'll explore the streets.

491
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,162
But you won't be able
to fight him at night.

492
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,624
Not without the protection of the Sun God.

493
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,294
Fortunately, my family
worships a night god.

494
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,421
Tzinacan owes me.

495
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,173
Blasphemy.

496
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:09,802
Cortés is a royal guest.
He's been offered hospitality by the king.

497
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,971
To touch him now
would merit a sentence of death.

498
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,225
This is why you trained me.
To avenge my father.

499
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,729
So if you won't help, then leave.

500
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,980
I release you from my service.

501
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,398
[pensive music playing]

502
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,569
My lord, in the spirit
of my continuing to assist you,

503
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,616
what say you to the idea
of wearing a costume?

504
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,291
[suspenseful music playing]

505
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,713
[gasps]

506
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,302
It's not gold, but it shines.

507
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,470
[laughs]

508
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,306
Please excuse my friend.
His manners are rather brash.

509
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,350
Please, consider it my gift to you.

510
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,895
I guess those rumors about the teúles
and gold turned out to be true.

511
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,855
But did you know
it's the sun's excrement?

512
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,525
[Cortés] How dare you?!

513
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,528
- Huh?
- [yells]

514
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,927
I'll gut you slowly,
like you're some pathetic little cur.

515
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,347
Wait! I want to see what he's capable of.

516
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,934
Your arrogance will be your death.

517
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,396
You took the words right out of my mouth.

518
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,940
[grunting, growling]

519
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,819
- [yells]
- You murdered my father!

520
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:56,701
I can't seem to recall
exactly who he was,

521
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,329
but when you see him again,
give him my regards.

522
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,165
[growls]

523
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,877
- [snarls]
- [screams]

524
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,468
Hand me the arbalest!

525
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,594
[whimpers]

526
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,346
[seethes]

527
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,612
- [soldier 1] Did you hear that?
- [soldier 2] Yes. Over here.

528
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,571
Let's go.

529
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,699
This isn't over.

530
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,248
Are you coming or not?

531
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,424
Wow! Did you feel that?

532
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,803
Yes. That was a really good fight.

533
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,055
[in monotone]
"Yes. That was a really good fight."

534
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,265
[in normal voice] Come on, get excited.

535
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,101
You could at least be a little thankful
you're still breathing.

536
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,395
Tlazocamati.

537
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,146
[sighs]

538
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,609
Thank you. I'm very grateful.
You were brave.

539
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,111
- You're pretending to be a Jaguar Goddess?
- Same as you.

540
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,532
Except I invoke the powerful,
untamed spirit of the jaguar.

541
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,076
Ah. I saw.

542
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,452
I'm intrigued.

543
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,663
What were you thinking
when you ran at them

544
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,248
like a chicken without its head?

545
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,834
That Cortés was weaker.

546
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,793
I was mistaken.

547
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:32,463
But I will find a way to defeat him,
no matter what it costs me.

548
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,882
Sounds suicidal.

549
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,801
I guess it's good
we have opposing missions, then.

550
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,885
Perhaps.

551
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,389
But at least mine's a mission of honor,
unlike certain people that--

552
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,183
- Steal? That's what you were gonna say?
- I didn't mean--

553
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,729
Next time, I'll just let them chop you up
for their soup like a tuna.

554
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,608
Hmm.

555
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,900
AXAYÁCATL'S PALACE

556
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,988
- I can close your wound, my captain.
- [Cortés] Find that bat and that cat.

557
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,031
But your infection will only worsen.

558
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,034
[Cortés] Drown them in the lake.

559
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,912
Then draw and quarter them.

560
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,998
Did you hear me, Pedro?

561
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,960
Mm-hm. Don't be upset,
but the men and I were talking,

562
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,463
and we think that back in Toledo
you'll find the best doctors in the world,

563
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,632
who can heal your...

564
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,259
Uh, your scratch.

565
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,595
I see.

566
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,265
You all wish to return home,
then, don't you?

567
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,474
[all gasp]

568
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:30,314
Perhaps, then, you need reminding
that there's still a mission to complete.

569
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,483
[sinister music playing]

570
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,323
That's why I commanded
all our ships be set ablaze.

571
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,490
[all gasp]

572
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,744
Now that you've all been made aware,

573
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,955
who wants stay here with me?

574
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:51,543
Anyone else can swim
all the way back to Cuba.

575
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:56,089
And then she used this whip
to balance herself and--

576
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,091
It's just... she's so resourceful.

577
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,595
- Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan!
- Huh?

578
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,014
- I'll make an offering.
- But she's not an actual goddess.

579
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,808
It's not for her.
It's for Tzinacan. [inhales]

580
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,769
Oh. All right.

581
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,105
- For sending her to save you.
- No. No one sent her to save me.

582
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,732
She stopped you from getting killed.

583
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,943
Of course she was sent
by him to save you.

584
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:21,405
Listen, the more important point here
is that, even with all of your training,

585
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,532
I can't defeat the teúles
and their weapons.

586
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,201
What's your next move, then?

587
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,536
I need to learn how their inventions work

588
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,789
and use that knowledge
to gain the upper hand.

589
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,582
But how will you even get close?

590
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,210
They're not going to invite you in
to study them.

591
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,255
- I'll be careful?
- Hmm. Too risky.

592
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,299
If only there was somebody
that you know

593
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,096
who was stealthy
and who had sticky fingers.

594
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,515
Perhaps they'd be able to help you.

595
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,642
Ahh.

596
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,895
[suspenseful music playing]

597
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:58,860
[chuckles softly]

598
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,154
[energetic music playing]

599
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,961
[music slows]

600
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:18,964
[gasps]

601
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,847
[gasps, then giggles]

602
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:28,974
[chuckles]

603
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,269
[gasps]

604
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,564
Huh?

605
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,067
[suspenseful music playing]

606
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:43,947
[gasps]

607
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,911
Didn't take long for you to miss me.

608
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,081
[grunts]

609
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,544
[yells] Stop! I'm not your enemy.

610
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,504
My mission's to take back what we've lost.

611
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,840
But you wouldn't understand,
since you're one of them.

612
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,177
I just want to talk.

613
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,596
- Then talk.
- Sorry for following you.

614
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,724
But I needed to know what you did
with the things you steal.

615
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,268
- And now that you know?
- You saved me.

616
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,895
I want to do the same thing for you.

617
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,647
But please, you have to stop stealing
from our people.

618
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,026
At least don't do it while Cortés
is trying to take everything from us.

619
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,195
And if I don't? You'll kill me?

620
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,489
No. But in these times,
someone else could.

621
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,575
Don't throw your life away
when you have so much to live for.

622
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,620
What do you care for the life
of another dishonorable thief?

623
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,873
A path of dishonor that aims
towards good deserves admiration.

624
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,543
Now, please. I could really use your help.

625
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,300
Must have been hard
realizing you needed me, wasn't it?

626
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,802
Looks like you were right.

627
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,513
By night, the guards patrol this place
in a pattern.

628
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,307
And if you want to get in
without having to fight them,

629
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,975
repeat the magic words.

630
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,186
I'm sorry for being rude to you.

631
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,271
I shall forever be in your debt,
great jaguar,

632
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,107
for teaching me the ways of the night.

633
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,526
Uh-huh. Very well.

634
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,738
Next time, try your best not to sound
like a chicken with its head cut off.

635
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,200
[stealthy music playing]

636
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,309
[ominous music spikes]

637
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,271
[yells, then grunts]

638
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,481
Pretty clever idea
to disarm the enemy from afar,

639
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,984
- don't you think?
- Mm.

640
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,831
Well, that's odd.

641
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,917
There's still a while
before the Atlcahualo festival.

642
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,422
These trees weren't for the festival.
Cortés is behind this.

643
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:09,217
- What's he doing with them?
- Nothing good.

644
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,556
[mysterious music playing]

645
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
Ah. Is this the place?

646
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,231
Yes. It was here.

647
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,445
- [gasps]
- This is the forgotten temple of Tzinacan.

648
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,156
I thought it was a myth, though.

649
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,623
[gasps]

650
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,881
So you said
that when you were wounded,

651
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:52,885
you ran all the way from your village
to a temple you had no idea existed,

652
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,804
one that your father had discovered
in his earlier years?

653
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,805
I got lucky.

654
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,350
Luck's has absolutely nothing
to do with this.

655
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,561
The Bat God guided you
that day to its lair.

656
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,521
Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan!

657
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,858
No! Stop it, Acatzin!

658
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,486
That day, Tzinacan left us all to die.

659
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,864
But, my lord, what about
the forest goddess that helped you?

660
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,824
She was nothing but a hallucination.

661
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,826
It was the fever, exhaustion, who knows?

662
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,288
You're so stubborn.
Blindness are those who refuse to see.

663
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,000
Stubborn and maddening are those
who see a stone god altar

664
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,127
and think it's listening to them.

665
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:32,174
You're the Bat God's chosen one, my lord.
You've been given a sacred mission.

666
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,802
And whether you accept it or not,
it's the truth.

667
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,638
If you really believe in the gods,
then let's test you.

668
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,767
Stand there and don't move a single finger
until night falls.

669
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,686
Yes, my lord. It'll be a great honor.

670
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,396
I'll be as still as a chinicuil worm

671
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,357
as it hides in the dirt
from a hungry bird.

672
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,820
Ah. Huh?

673
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,698
No! Get them off me! Get them off me!

674
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,367
See, guess it's not such a sacred mission
after all, is it?

675
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,745
[determined music playing]

676
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,334
[determined music continues]

677
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,117
[music fades out]

678
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,577
[gasps]

679
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,663
[ethereal music playing]

680
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,208
You do exist. Forgive me for doubting.

681
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,253
You're not the first nor the last
to have doubted.

682
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,755
Ask your questions.

683
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:56,175
Tell me how to defeat Cortés.
How to get the teúles out of the city.

684
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,012
Without him, you don't exist.

685
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,222
Without him, you cannot win.

686
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,516
Is it better to earn his trust
or kill him?

687
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,894
What's Cortés doing with all those trees?

688
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,437
When empires clash,

689
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,564
some will rise,

690
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,232
others fall.

691
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,902
A great metamorphosis will take place,

692
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:18,822
and the gods shall anoint
their chosen emissaries,

693
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,867
whether they know it or not.

694
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,660
Balance depends on them.

695
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Not by way of vengeance

696
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,581
but through sacrifice.

697
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,209
For all must move in eternal momentum.

698
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,880
I don't understand you!
Stop speaking in riddles for once!

699
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,967
[in booming voice]
Respect the will of the gods!

700
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,221
[gasps, then pants]

701
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:42,930
Was it a vision?

702
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,850
[sighs] Just go back to sleep.

703
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:51,563
Oftentimes the gods use dreams
as a way to speak to the chosen ones.

704
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,109
That's how they offer guidance
during times of great adversity.

705
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,445
Then someone should tell them
to be a little less confusing.

706
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,572
Well, some gods speak to you plainly,

707
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,910
while there are others
who will act quiet or more evasive.

708
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,828
Some visit to tell you the truth,

709
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:10,375
while others seek to deceive
and torment you, such as Tezcatlipoca.

710
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,210
You must be extremely careful
with that god.

711
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,547
[sighs] Try and get some sleep.

712
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,591
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

713
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,433
[man] Our people believe
that they have powers,

714
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,810
but they don't think they are gods.

715
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,728
The white rock discovered
upon their arrival is proof

716
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,315
that they are correct,
contrary to all that Yoka has said.

717
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,901
Tell him he must feed them.

718
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,195
That he is wrong about the teúles.

719
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,613
They are hungry.

720
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,823
Oh, good, my lord.

721
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,491
Huitzilopochtli, he assures me

722
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,078
our visitors are not some sort
of cosmic test we must overcome.

723
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,414
On the contrary,
we must satisfy their hunger.

724
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,917
Your answer is always
more and more sacrifices.

725
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,127
You disappoint me, Yoka.

726
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,713
Now I am certain
that for us to achieve peace,

727
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:01,341
every member of this kingdom
will have to right their wrongs,

728
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,509
including you!

729
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,179
[Yoka yells in fear]

730
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,890
No! Not this! No!

731
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:11,143
- I beg you, my lord, no!
- You are hereby banished, Yoka.

732
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:14,062
Go to the mountain
and contemplate the ruin

733
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,315
that your choices have brought upon us.

734
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,692
But I am your most faithful!

735
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:23,573
I am the gods' messenger!
Please, I don't deserve this!

736
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,748
[dramatic music playing]

737
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:33,666
[yells]

738
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,336
[whinnying]

739
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:38,963
Huh?

740
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,926
To arms! It's the Bat Warrior!

741
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,608
[horses whinny]

742
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:00,985
[both gasp]

743
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:07,282
Dealing with this infernal bat is starting
to become quite the endless headache.

744
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,328
For now, there's a more urgent matter
we must attend to.

745
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,123
Ah, yes.

746
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,837
It seems the glorious governor
of the island of Cuba

747
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,882
is ordering me to return,

748
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,177
like some useless mongrel!

749
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,179
What's his messenger been up to?

750
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,515
Watching everything
so he may report you.

751
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,809
Send him inside.

752
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,435
Did you reconsider?

753
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,688
Will you obey Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar,

754
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,233
officer of King Charles
and governor of Cuba?

755
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,236
Or would you prefer I call the army
to haul you back in chains?

756
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,739
[menacing music playing]

757
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,995
Ah, of course I shall comply
with this order.

758
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,208
Tell me, how would you care to join us
on a secret mission?

759
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,209
What do you say, hmm?

760
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,586
Very well.

761
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,422
I couldn't ask for more.

762
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,140
What else do you require, my lord?

763
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,933
Fear.

764
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,312
[pensive music playing]

765
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,695
[music turns dramatic]

766
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,175
[music fades out]

767
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:52,262
Thank you for agreeing to make
the offerings before we begin our trials.

768
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,264
Yes.

769
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,807
It's the right thing to do.

770
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,517
Do you remember how to say it?

771
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,144
Tlacatlé,

772
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,730
totecoé Tzinacan.

773
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,607
Oh, thank the gods.

774
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,776
I thought that I had failed you, my lord.

775
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,488
- I, who am just but a humble--
- Acatzin...

776
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,782
other than my father,

777
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,827
you are without a doubt
the best man I've ever known.

778
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:20,083
I feel like Tzinacan would smile
if he saw me leap into the fray.

779
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,669
Don't you think?

780
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,590
[Acatzin] I'm grateful
you finally accepted your destiny.

781
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,885
Break your backs
if that's what will get it up there.

782
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,596
- Pull!
- [soldiers grunting]

783
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,809
Excellent work, gentlemen. Take a break.

784
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,810
[groans]

785
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,062
Nature calls.

786
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,022
[gasps]

787
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,983
[dramatic music playing]

788
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,487
On your feet, you vermin!
We're under attack!

789
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,705
Quick! Put it out!

790
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:02,333
[soldiers shouting]

791
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,213
[dramatic music swells]

792
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:12,801
[panting] Bravo. I see that you've made
a few improvements.

793
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,762
You took the words right out of my mouth.

794
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,390
[growls]

795
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,361
[gasps]

796
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:40,245
[clears throat] Was this mission
supposed to show me your abilities?

797
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:44,541
Too few of you understand
what Almighty God has given me.

798
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,669
The opportunity to finally sit
on a throne.

799
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,672
A throne? Just the one in a Cuban jail
where you shall face judgment.

800
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,133
He has also told me

801
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:57,388
my hands control the power of destiny.

802
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,726
Hmm. Fate can be cruel.

803
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,061
By the Lord and his saints, you're--

804
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,605
You're a monster!

805
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:09,692
- [sword pierces flesh]
- [gurgling]

806
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,363
Goddamn you!

807
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,866
It was the Bat!

808
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,368
He was the one
who murdered Diego's messenger.

809
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,663
I shall see you're avenged, my friend.

810
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,373
Leave him there. Let's return to the city.

811
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,418
[chuckles] You'll need
some new armor first, captain.

812
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,378
Some new armor.

813
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,005
[chuckles coldly]

814
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,550
And a new strategy.

815
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,553
[grim music playing]

816
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,269
[Cortés] It's outrageous!

817
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,606
To be waylaid like this
on an excursion through the forest.

818
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,191
My men and I, we come in peace.

819
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,485
But I answer to King Charles,

820
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:57,323
and he is not nearly as merciful
as my God is.

821
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,200
But why not inform me
you all were leaving the city?

822
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,327
And why were you in the forest at night?

823
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,372
That's not what's important here.
We were attacked.

824
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,499
[sighs]

825
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:11,920
For this reason, I humbly request
the Sun King accompany us

826
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,297
to avoid any future attacks.

827
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,469
[Moctezuma] I will go with you
as compensation for your losses, sir.

828
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,263
Please, if you would accept,

829
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:24,307
I wish for you and your men
to be my guests of honor

830
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,352
at our Tóxcatl festival.

831
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,145
Your Highness is too generous.

832
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,107
I'd like to do my part
to avoid future misunderstandings

833
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:36,278
and to promote a better understanding
between both of our peoples.

834
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,239
I'd be very eager to hear your proposal.

835
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,700
Huey tlatoani, I volunteer in your stead

836
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,286
to be companion
to the esteemed Captain Cortés.

837
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:47,163
I'll answer his questions
and learn with him,

838
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,416
and from him.

839
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,712
Very well. Our war leader
shall accompany you henceforth.

840
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:56,716
[crowd murmuring, praying]

841
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,065
I gave my life to the king!

842
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,735
To our people!

843
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,028
How am I repaid?

844
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,614
With humiliation and disgrace.

845
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:23,533
Show Moctezuma his mistake.

846
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,038
He must see just how immaculate you are.

847
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:31,125
That your faith is pure and undeniable.

848
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,501
Yes. My faith.

849
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,295
With all of its power,

850
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,506
it will drive away Cortés
and that citlālim popōca.

851
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,635
Precisely.

852
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,762
Such zealous ingenuity

853
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,557
is why you are my chosen one.

854
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,727
[drumming & chatter in distance]

855
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:55,774
Do you also believe that the citlāl-pōca
up in the sky predicts misfortune?

856
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,775
[chuckles]

857
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:59,612
I think its appearance,
alongside your arrival,

858
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,404
is not a good sign.

859
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,950
We also used to believe that the comet,
the name we call it,

860
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,868
was the portent of a bad omen.

861
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,286
TLATELOLCO'S MARKET

862
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,206
But today we know
it's simply a floating ball of gas

863
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,625
revolving around our world
in the cosmos,

864
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,586
just like the sun and the moon.

865
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,465
Are you saying you believe
the sun revolves around this world?

866
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,800
It's been proven.

867
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,302
You don't think so as well?

868
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:25,930
No.

869
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,890
Our people have known for many suns now

870
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,519
that this world
isn't the center of anything.

871
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,897
Well, if you know so much...

872
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:40,026
[laughs] then why didn't you all
discover us before we discovered you?

873
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,529
Your people already have your own magic,

874
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,072
your own world.

875
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,907
What exactly do you want from us?

876
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,618
Oh, it doesn't matter how much you have,

877
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,287
because you can always
have something more.

878
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,541
Isn't it important
how you go about getting it?

879
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,794
Does your god approve the slaughter
of women and children?

880
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,673
In this world, our souls shall be tested.

881
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:04,175
The more difficult
the test we face becomes,

882
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,344
the more pure we shall be as a result.

883
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,722
That is not...

884
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,806
That's not an answer.

885
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,849
The sad reality

886
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,978
is that sometimes a leader will be forced
to make some decisions that are difficult.

887
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,481
But what if those decisions they make
are wrong?

888
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:25,114
When that happens,
I'll make sure you're the first to know.

889
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,539
Come here, my love! I want a hug!

890
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,917
Give me a big hug!

891
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,127
How I've missed you, my son.

892
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,254
Oh, it's been far too long.

893
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,466
I'm so happy
that you've finally come back home.

894
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,843
Yoka, come. Come. Come in.

895
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,179
Come in. Come in.

896
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,144
Why so serious?

897
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:59,398
You've always smiled
since you were little.

898
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:04,445
The work of the gods
is a serious matter, Mother.

899
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,281
You saw citlālim popōca?

900
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,201
It appeared the same day as Cortés
and all of his soldiers.

901
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,243
[sniffs]

902
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,288
And if we fail in our duty
to feed the gods,

903
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,332
it shall spell doom for our people.

904
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,833
[tense music playing]

905
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,629
Now I must ask you, Mother...

906
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,341
to put your trust in me.

907
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:27,927
Are you certain?

908
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,138
Moctezuma also agrees with you?

909
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,556
You're sure this is the right thing?

910
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,058
Yes.

911
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,519
[ominous music spikes]

912
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,066
Then we place our faith
in your hands, Yoka.

913
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,529
Without any risk,
there would be no reward.

914
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,073
This festival shall be the perfect moment.

915
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,699
You will be in charge.

916
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,701
The plan hinges on you.

917
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,829
So don't screw it up.

918
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,123
If we were to call
upon the Tlaxcaltecas,

919
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,583
then we wouldn't need
to divide our forces like this.

920
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,585
And why would you share with someone,

921
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,841
when you might easily have it
all for yourself, Pedro?

922
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,220
This way, we kill two birds
with one stone.

923
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,394
Am I interrupting?

924
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,604
No. Perfect timing.

925
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,815
We received some stupendous news just now,

926
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,859
and we're planning a surprise
for your people.

927
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,820
You do all enjoy surprises, hmm?

928
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,614
Well, that all depends on the surprise.

929
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,783
What did you say?

930
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,368
Nothing.

931
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,078
Hmm. Right.

932
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,790
Pardon me. I must go get ready.

933
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,669
Tonight things shall take
quite a radical turn.

934
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,382
Citlālim popōca's still there.

935
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,925
Cortés is still armed.

936
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,219
He taunts you at every turn.

937
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,513
Oh, he isn't taunting me,

938
00:57:55,514 --> 00:58:00,686
for it's been I
that's taunted you since the start.

939
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,229
What are you saying, Huitzilopochtli?

940
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,108
[in demonic voice]
I am not Huitzilopochtli.

941
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,195
[laughing maniacally]

942
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,405
Tezcatlipoca?

943
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,490
Wretched deceiver!

944
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,577
But don't worry,
for you're still my chosen one.

945
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:23,082
Providing ways of testing people like you
is why I exist in the first place.

946
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,501
But what have I done to be punished so?

947
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,756
You were always far too eager
to dismiss the idea of your own sacrifice,

948
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,634
because you are nothing.

949
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,509
You're no one.

950
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,969
It must all be a dream.

951
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,638
It's only a nightmare.

952
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,973
Only a nightmare. Yes, yes.

953
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,516
Oh, and, you know,

954
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,061
your mother really had a point.

955
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,939
You should smile more, Yoka.

956
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,192
[sobbing]

957
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,076
How can I earn your forgiveness? [sobbing]

958
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,912
What? Mother? Is that you?

959
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,248
Tell me.

960
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,582
Ohh.

961
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,709
[sinister music playing]

962
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,878
Yes, I will, Mother.

963
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,297
I will make sure I enjoy life.

964
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,550
And smile. I promise.

965
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,177
I promise.

966
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,264
[laughing maniacally]

967
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,369
[suspenseful music playing]

968
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,216
You're mine.

969
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:10,816
[growling]

970
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:16,613
[whinnies]

971
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:22,828
[growls]

972
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:31,086
TÓXCATL'S FESTIVAL

973
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,394
[music stops]

974
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,106
[suspenseful music playing]

975
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,609
Do you want blood? I shall give you blood.

976
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,487
- Calm down, Pedro.
- [grunts]

977
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,908
I knew it was you in there, Yohualli.

978
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,701
I could sense you.

979
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,080
I saw it in the way
that you forged metal.

980
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,123
But I couldn't be certain.

981
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,293
That is, until I heard you quote the words
of your father.

982
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,629
Good. Now you won't be surprised

983
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,714
when I end your terror.

984
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:19,842
You are truly one hell of a warrior.

985
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:24,555
Too bad you aren't back in the city
to defend Moctezuma.

986
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:25,640
[laughs]

987
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,935
He could use the help
of someone of your talents

988
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:31,729
when we pay him a visit tonight.

989
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,856
No.

990
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,526
[ominous music playing]

991
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:42,156
[laughs] Yes. Did you think
this circus we put on here

992
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,783
was about you?

993
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,537
My friend, despite our history,

994
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:50,541
you are nothing but my dessert.

995
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,014
[growls]

996
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,319
You wretched bastard.

997
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,490
The captain's not going to like this.

998
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,783
MASSACRE IN THE GREAT TEMPLE

999
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,953
They started it. Now clean that filth up.

1000
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,831
[ominous music playing]

1001
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,667
[gasps]

1002
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:42,842
Well... there you are, Your Highness.

1003
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:46,387
You wanted a festival of blood.
Well, there you have it.

1004
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,139
Hold him there.

1005
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,892
And kill the others.

1006
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,520
[gasps] What have I done?

1007
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,237
No!

1008
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,071
- [growls]
- [soldier] Kill him!

1009
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,159
The Bat Demon has finally come!
Keep shooting!

1010
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,745
Fire!

1011
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,875
Seal those damn doors already.

1012
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,510
"Without him, you don't exist."

1013
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:29,138
She meant Tzinacan, not Cortés.

1014
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,683
Acatzin, you and my tahtli
have been right all along.

1015
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,895
Cortés is the bull.
And the Bat God is who protects me.

1016
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,524
How could I not see it sooner?
I'm such an idiot.

1017
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,735
[conch trumpeting in distance]

1018
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,074
The horn of the king. He's summoning us.

1019
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,743
Maybe he escaped.

1020
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,829
I don't think that's the king.
I can only hope that we're not too late.

1021
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,415
Did my father leave any gold?

1022
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,835
[crowd murmuring]

1023
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,469
[crowd clamoring angrily]

1024
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,895
[gasps]

1025
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,232
How dare they lay hands on the king?

1026
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,692
[crowd gasps]

1027
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,319
The life of your beloved king

1028
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,282
depends on how well
you all behave yourselves.

1029
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:34,079
Your own warriors will be in charge
of making sure you vermin comply.

1030
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,873
[laughs] What I want is gold.

1031
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,085
Not one piece or two.

1032
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,463
You see, I want all of it.

1033
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,882
All of the gold there is.

1034
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,552
I want it now!

1035
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,808
Yes.

1036
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,020
This is exactly what I desire.

1037
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,688
[chuckling coldly] Yes.

1038
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:02,774
[crowd clamoring angrily]

1039
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,444
For the love of Moctezuma!

1040
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:09,990
No, stay back.
We don't want to have to hurt you.

1041
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,994
[Cortés] Yes. [laughing maniacally]

1042
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,538
More.

1043
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:18,915
More!

1044
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,460
I want it all!

1045
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:24,546
[crowd clamoring angrily]

1046
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:32,845
Why didn't you do it? Vengeance was yours.
It was within your grasp.

1047
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,931
Because what happens here depends
on something far greater than me.

1048
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,894
Cortés must stand and face our justice,
not my vengeance.

1049
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:41,395
What's your plan, then?

1050
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,482
Our warriors won't be able to fight.

1051
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,317
Not while the king is being held prisoner.

1052
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,361
That's why I have to free him.

1053
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:50,030
Huh. How easy.

1054
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,826
[solemn music playing]

1055
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,340
- [Catwoman] Nice shrine.
- [gasps]

1056
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,510
Better make that last prayer count.

1057
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:18,975
- I'll go get the weapons ready.
- Bring all of them.

1058
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,477
- You came here to help me?
- No.

1059
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,479
- Just to say farewell.
- Farewell?

1060
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,939
And that's all?

1061
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,858
Don't get me wrong,
you're quite interesting.

1062
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,735
But not enough to risk death.

1063
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,862
Not when so many people
still depend on me.

1064
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,075
I understand. I have to go and get ready.

1065
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:39,412
I'm sure what you're planning to do
is probably insane.

1066
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,915
But that doesn't mean it can't be
something pure and selfless either.

1067
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,583
To catch a glimpse of that is rare.

1068
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,462
I wanted to see it and wish you the best.

1069
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,381
Thank you.

1070
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,937
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [blades pierce flesh & guards grunt]

1071
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,523
- [spear clangs]
- [gasps]

1072
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,486
[gasps]

1073
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:17,075
I beg you, Tzinacan,
spare me from your vengeance.

1074
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,661
Pardon this bastard disgrace
of an emperor.

1075
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,331
I thought I saw a god
where there was nothing but death.

1076
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,001
[sobbing] Now I don't know what to do.

1077
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:30,087
Cortés and his soldiers are not gods.

1078
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,048
They're evil men who must be stopped.

1079
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:36,135
Summon your warriors.
Tell them to rise and fight back.

1080
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,181
Yes, O powerful Tzinacan.

1081
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:47,897
[knife slits flesh]

1082
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:51,317
Your sacrifice won't be for naught,
nor will your armor.

1083
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,403
[laughing maniacally]

1084
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,283
Move it! Hurry up!

1085
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,243
[Cortés] What did I tell you, Pedro?

1086
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,704
[Pedro] You told me that we would be rich

1087
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,040
and that, after all the bribes
had been made,

1088
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,418
we would all live like kings.

1089
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,506
[seethes] If I see one more feather...

1090
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:17,052
No more useless bird feathers!

1091
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:23,308
Or I'll hang your king next to all those
who've dared provoke my anger!

1092
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,896
[conch trumpeting]

1093
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,776
Captain, we have to get out of here
right now.

1094
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,028
[conch trumpeting]

1095
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,281
Ahuaque tepehuaque, I have a message!

1096
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:43,160
One that I heard directly!
It's from Tzinacan himself!

1097
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,286
[crowd jeering]

1098
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,956
Listen! Listen to me, I beg you!

1099
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,457
I know I've failed you,

1100
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,377
that I've made mistakes,
but the Bat God has visited me--

1101
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,463
[groaning]

1102
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,177
[laughing coldly]

1103
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:04,182
It seems you've lost the trust
of your people, my lord.

1104
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,059
Fear not.

1105
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,187
There's one way
you may still help the cause.

1106
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,440
[Moctezuma groaning]

1107
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,985
And that's with your death.

1108
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,987
[Yoka laughing maniacally]

1109
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:21,657
Your fear is the reason

1110
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,119
your empire dies with you.

1111
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,248
- [laughing maniacally]
- [Yoka laughing maniacally]

1112
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,462
[all gasp]

1113
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,464
The teúles have slain Moctezuma.

1114
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,551
[laughing maniacally]

1115
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,348
Huey tlatoani has been murdered.

1116
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:49,852
Now our plans have been ruined, you fools!

1117
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:53,022
'Tis nothing our swords cannot remedy,
my captain.

1118
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,941
To the palace. Until more troops arrive.

1119
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,694
[all shouting]

1120
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,197
[groans]

1121
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,711
Just 50 meters more.

1122
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,548
This is war, gentlemen. Give them hell!

1123
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:29,935
Ocelotl!

1124
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,311
At your service, great Tzinacan.

1125
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:35,607
The horn. Summon all of our warriors. Now.

1126
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,947
[horn blowing eerily]

1127
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,497
O great and powerful Bat God,

1128
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:54,417
grant me a weapon
that may vanquish the pale invaders.

1129
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,671
Tzinacan, here are the weapons.

1130
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,970
Never again.
Not one shall set foot in these halls!

1131
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,389
They shall not take this sacred throne!

1132
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,642
[all yelling in unison]

1133
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,478
Attack!

[Yoha growls]

1139
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,461
[Yoha] Cortés!

1140
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:48,722
- I am going to end you.
- Let's finish this.

1141
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,935
[Ocelotl yells]

1142
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,274
Get the cannon ready! Load it and fire!

1143
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:04,904
Fire!

1144
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,993
[warriors yelling]

1145
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:13,997
It is inevitable, Yohualli.

1146
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,208
There always must be a loser.

1147
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,048
Fire!

1148
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,308

[soldiers yelling]

1150
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,192
[Yoha] You were saying?

1151
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,651
Yes.

1152
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,280
I was saying... [laughs coldly]

1153
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:53,745
...that God Almighty himself
always safeguards my victory.

1154
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:59,793
Now let's see if your gods
move a single finger for you!

1155
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,843
- [sword pierces flesh]
- [groaning]

1156

[rumbling in distance]

1157
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:31,198
In case you were wondering
what all of that wood we cut down was for.

1158
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,491
[laughs coldly]

1159
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:36,746
All that remains
is to leave it up to fate.

1160
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:43,044
Damn you!

1161
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,133
[gasps]

1162
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,262
[warrior] For Huitzilopochtli!

1163
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,767
Fire!

1164
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,278
On all I hold sacred,
I will destroy this city.

1165
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:13,074
I am your new god now!

1166
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,785
[groaning]

1167
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,038
I knew you'd come back.

1168
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,584
[chuckles] Oh, really? I didn't.

1169
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,378
My lord, you're wounded!

1170
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,881
It's just a scratch.

1171
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:33,928
- Did you do as I asked?
- I placed it at the top of the temple.

1172
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,187
[Catwoman] All you have to do
is jump off this wall?

1173
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:44,855
- I mean, you're joking me, right?
- No.

1174
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,358
I followed what
all of their writings said.

1175
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:53,614
It'll work. I've got to try. [grunts]

1176
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:55,908
Are you sure
you'll be able to pull this off?

1177
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:58,327
A little blood
has never stopped me before.

1178
01:14:58,328 --> 01:14:59,661

1180
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,335
Here, for good luck.

1181
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,976
I knew it! He is the chosen one!

1182
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,315
[warrior] Tzinacan is here!

1183
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:31,194
The Bat God has come
to fight alongside us!

1184
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,282
[soldier] They've invoked
an infernal winged demon!

1185
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,201
Impossible.

1186
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,703
[warriors cheering]

1187
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,872

[grunting]

1189
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,629
Come on. I know we can pull through.

Gunners, load. And fire!

1195
01:16:56,446 --> 01:17:00,742
Don't stop shooting, soldiers of God!
Slaughter them all!

1196
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:04,162
Tlacatlé, totecoé Tzinacan.

1197
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,955
I know I should've been a better servant,

1198
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:10,042
but please permit me
to see my mission through,

1199
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,002
and I'll submit to your power

1200
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:13,796
and take the path to Mictlán.

1201
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,843
Fire!

1202
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,678
No!

1203
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,808
Axcan kema, tehuatl, nehuatl!

1204
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:39,781
- What?

1208

[breathing raggedly]

1212
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:12,355
I will make you bow to me!

1213
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,649
I'd rather die!

1214
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:25,325
Those wounds look dire.
You won't last much longer.

1215
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:28,037
I've got long enough
to bring you to justice.

[dramatic music playing]

1217
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,094

01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:42,235
- [man 1] The ill omen has ended!
- [woman 2] The gods have granted us mercy!

1225
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:45,031
[man 2] We have been blessed
by the blood of the dead!

1226
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,075
[all cheering]

1227
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,924
[Cortés] Am I not your chosen one?

1228
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:05,842
[sobbing]

1229
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:08,428
Why have you forsaken me, Lord?

1230
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,388
Why did I fail?

1231
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,099
This can't be it.

1232
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:16,854
Captain, perhaps we could improve
our strategy to take the city?

1233
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,982
Send a message to Xicotencatl,

1234
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:23,027
the leader of the Tlaxcaltecas.

1235
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:26,613
Tell him that he and I must speak.

1236
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:31,035
[Yoka] And repeat
the same stupid mistakes,

1237
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,369
captain?

1238
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,828
[laughs coldly]

1239
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,542
I will...

1240
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,462
make the throne yours.

1241
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,632
[laughing maniacally]

1242
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,388
- [poignant music playing]
- [crowd crying]

1243
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:52,640
Look at you.

1244
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,309
[sobbing]

1245
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,063
Such a fool.
Look at what you've done.

1246
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,691
A wise man told me once...

1247
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,193
"Fear can kill you

1248
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,821
or inspire you to action."

1249
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,947
I'm glad I was there to save you.

1250
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:11,450
You shouldn't have sacrificed
yourself like that.

1251
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,666
Fate leaves me with no regrets.

1252
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,293
Well...

1253
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,629
maybe there's one thing I'll regret.

1254
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:28,634
- [sobs softly]
- [sobbing] My boy.

1255
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:43,274
[serene music playing]

1256
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:01,875
Now rest in peace, Yohualli Coatl.

1257
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:04,795
Young Shadow of Chief Toltecatzin.

1258
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,799
Tzinacan's chosen one
and sacred Bat Protector.

1259
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,843
Rest in peace.

1260
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,182
Sleep until Quetzalcoatl...

1261
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,643
our creator,

1262
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:22,855
decides that he needs you back
in this world.

1263
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,803
- [Catwoman] Do you think this is over?
- No.

1264
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,098
I fear there's far more evil to come.

1265
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:03,187
[ominous percussive music playing
& man chanting in gravelly voice]

1266
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,421
[dramatic Nahuatl rock music playing]

1267
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:08,669
[song ends]

1268
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:27,897
[solemn organ music playing]

1269
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,819
[music fades out]

1270
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,906
[wheezing]

1271
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,871
[ominous percussive music playing]

1272
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,833
[music turns energetic]

1273
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,329
[suspenseful percussive music playing]
